  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>Linked Data [[LINKED-DATA]] is a way to create a network of
   standards-based machine interpretable data across different documents and
   Web sites. It allows an application to start at one piece of Linked Data,
   and follow embedded links to other pieces of Linked Data that are hosted on
   different sites across the Web.</p>

  <p>JSON-LD is a lightweight syntax to serialize Linked Data in
    JSON [[!RFC8259]]. Its design allows existing JSON to be interpreted as
    Linked Data with minimal changes. JSON-LD is primarily intended to be a
    way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments, to build
    interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines. Since
    JSON-LD is 100% compatible with JSON, the large number of JSON parsers and libraries
    available today can be reused. In addition to all the features JSON provides,
    JSON-LD introduces:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>a universal identifier mechanism for <a>JSON objects</a>
      via the use of <a>IRIs</a>,</li>
    <li>a way to disambiguate keys shared among different JSON documents by mapping
      them to <a>IRIs</a> via a <a>context</a>,</li>
    <li>a mechanism in which a value in a <a>JSON object</a> may refer
      to a <a>resource</a> on a different site on the Web,</li>
    <li>the ability to annotate <a>strings</a> with their language,</li>
    <li>a way to associate datatypes with values such as dates and times,</li>
    <li>and a facility to express one or more directed graphs, such as a social
      network, in a single document.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
   JSON-LD is designed to be usable directly as JSON, with no knowledge of RDF
   [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]]. It is also designed to be usable as RDF, if desired, for
   use with other Linked Data technologies like SPARQL. Developers who
   require any of the facilities listed above or need to serialize an RDF <a>Graph</a>
   or <a>Dataset</a> in a JSON-based syntax will find JSON-LD of interest. People
   intending to use JSON-LD with RDF tools will find it can be used as another
   RDF syntax, as with [[Turtle]] and [[TriG]]. Complete details of how JSON-LD relates
   to RDF are in section <a href="#relationship-to-rdf"></a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The syntax is designed to not disturb already
   deployed systems running on JSON, but provide a smooth upgrade path from
   JSON to JSON-LD. Since the shape of such data varies wildly, JSON-LD
   features mechanisms to reshape documents into a deterministic structure
   which simplifies their processing.</p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>How to Read this Document</h2>

    <p>This document is a detailed specification for a serialization of Linked
      Data in JSON. The document is primarily intended for the following audiences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Software developers who want to encode Linked Data in a variety of
        programming languages that can use JSON</li>
      <li>Software developers who want to convert existing JSON to JSON-LD</li>
      <li>Software developers who want to understand the design decisions and
        language syntax for JSON-LD</li>
      <li>Software developers who want to implement processors and APIs for
        JSON-LD</li>
      <li>Software developers who want to generate or consume Linked Data,
        an RDF <a>graph</a>, or an <a>RDF Dataset</a> in a JSON syntax</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A companion document, the JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification
      [[JSON-LD11-API]], specifies how to work with JSON-LD at a higher level by
      providing a standard library interface for common JSON-LD operations.</p>

    <p>To understand the basics in this specification you must first be familiar with
      <a data-cite="RFC8259">JSON</a>, which is detailed in [[!RFC8259]].</p>

    <p>This document almost exclusively uses the term IRI
    (<a data-cite="ld-glossary#internationalized-resource-identifier">Internationalized Resource Indicator</a>)
    when discussing hyperlinks. Many Web developers are more familiar with the
    URL (<a data-cite="ld-glossary#uniform-resource-locator">Uniform Resource Locator</a>)
    terminology. The document also uses, albeit rarely, the URI
    (<a data-cite="ld-glossary#uniform-resource-identifier">Uniform Resource Indicator</a>)
    terminology. While these terms are often used interchangeably among
    technical communities, they do have important distinctions from one
    another and the specification goes to great lengths to try and use the
    proper terminology at all times.

  <h2>Design Goals and Rationale</h2>

  <p>JSON-LD satisfies the following design goals:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt>Simplicity</dt>
   <dd>No extra processors or software libraries are necessary to use JSON-LD
     in its most basic form. The language provides developers with a very easy
     learning curve. Developers only need to know JSON and two
     <a>keywords</a> (<code>@context</code>
     and <code>@id</code>) to use the basic functionality in JSON-LD.</dd>
   <dt>Compatibility</dt>
   <dd>A JSON-LD document is always a valid JSON document. This ensures that
    all of the standard JSON libraries work seamlessly with JSON-LD documents.</dd>
   <dt>Expressiveness</dt>
   <dd>The syntax serializes directed graphs. This ensures that almost
    every real world data model can be expressed.</dd>
   <dt>Terseness</dt>
   <dd>The JSON-LD syntax is very terse and human readable, requiring as
    little effort as possible from the developer.</dd>
   <dt>Zero Edits, most of the time</dt>
   <dd>JSON-LD ensures a smooth and simple transition from existing
     JSON-based systems. In many cases,
     zero edits to the JSON document and the addition of one line to the HTTP response
     should suffice (see <a class="sectionRef" href="#interpreting-json-as-json-ld"></a>).
     This allows organizations that have
     already deployed large JSON-based infrastructure to use JSON-LD's features
     in a way that is not disruptive to their day-to-day operations and is
     transparent to their current customers. However, there are times where
     mapping JSON to a graph representation is a complex undertaking.
     In these instances, rather than extending JSON-LD to support
     esoteric use cases, we chose not to support the use case. While Zero
     Edits is a design goal, it is not always possible without adding
     great complexity to the language. JSON-LD focuses on simplicity when
     possible.</dd>
    <dt>Usable as RDF</dt>
    <dd>JSON-LD is usable by developers as
      idiomatic JSON, with no need to understand RDF [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]].
      JSON-LD is also usable as RDF, so people intending to use JSON-LD
      with RDF tools will find it can be used like any other RDF syntax.
      Complete details of how JSON-LD relates to RDF are in section
      <a href="#relationship-to-rdf"></a>.</dd>

    <h2>Data Model Overview</h2>

    <p>Generally speaking, the data model described by a
      <a>JSON-LD document</a> is a labeled,
      directed <a>graph</a>. The graph contains
      <a>nodes</a>, which are connected by
      <a>edges</a>. A <a>node</a> is typically data
      such as a <a>string</a>, <a>number</a>,
      <a>typed values</a> (like dates and times)
      or an <a>IRI</a>.</p>
    <p class="changed">Within a directed graph, nodes with may
      be <em>unnamed</em>, i.e., not identified by an <a>IRI</a> or representing
      data such as <a>strings</a> or <a>numbers</a>. Such nodes are called <a>blank nodes</a>,
      and may be identified using a <a>blank node identifier</a>.
      These identifiers may be required to represent a fully connected graph
      using a tree structure, such as JSON, but otherwise have no
      intrinsic meaning.</p>
    <p>This simple data model is incredibly
      flexible and powerful, capable of modeling almost any kind of
      data. For a deeper explanation of the data model, see
      section <a href="#data-model"></a>.</p>

    <p>Developers who are familiar with Linked Data technologies will
      recognize the data model as the RDF Data Model. To dive deeper into how
      JSON-LD and RDF are related, see
      section <a href="#relationship-to-rdf"></a>.</p>

    <p>At the surface level, a <a>JSON-LD document</a> is simply
      <a data-cite="RFC8259">JSON</a>, detailed in [[!RFC8259]].
      For the purpose of describing the core data structures,
      this is limited to <a>arrays</a>, <a>dictionaries</a> (the parsed version of a <a>JSON Object</a>),
      <a>strings</a>, <a>numbers</a>, <a>booleans</a>, and <a>null</a>,
      <span class="changed">called the <a>JSON-LD internal representation</a>.
        This allows surface syntaxes other than JSON
        to be manipulated using the same algorithms, when the syntax maps
        to equivalent core data structures</span>.</p>
      <p class="changed note">Although not discussed in this specification,
        parallel work using <a data-cite="YAML">YAML</a> [[YAML]]
        and binary representations such as <a data-cite="RFC7049">CBOR</a> [[RFC7049]]
        could be used to map into the <a>internal representation</a>, allowing
        the JSON-LD 1.1 API [[JSON-LD11-API]] to operate as if the source was a
        JSON document.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="normative">
    <h2>Syntax Tokens and Keywords</h2>

    <p>JSON-LD specifies a number of syntax tokens and <a>keywords</a>
    that are a core part of the language:</p>

    <dl data-sort>
      <dt><code>@context</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to define the short-hand names that are used throughout a JSON-LD
        document. These short-hand names are called <a>terms</a> and help
        developers to express specific identifiers in a compact manner. The
        <code>@context</code> keyword is described in detail in
        <a class="sectionRef" href="#the-context"></a>.</dd>
      <dt><code>@id</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to uniquely identify <a>node objects</a> that are being described in the document
        with <a>IRIs</a> or
        <a>blank node identifiers</a>. This keyword
        is described in <a class="sectionRef" href="#node-identifiers"></a>.</dd>
      <dt><code>@value</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to specify the data that is associated with a particular
        <a>property</a> in the graph. This keyword is described in
        <a class="sectionRef" href="#string-internationalization"></a> and
        <a class="sectionRef" href="#typed-values"></a>.</dd>
      <dt><code>@language</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to specify the language for a particular string value or the default
        language of a JSON-LD document. This keyword is described in
        <a class="sectionRef" href="#string-internationalization"></a>.</dd>
      <dt><code>@type</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to set the data type of a <a>node</a> or
        <a>typed value</a>. This keyword is described in
        <a class="sectionRef" href="#typed-values"></a>.</dd>
      <dt><code>@container</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to set the default container type for a <a>term</a>.
        This keyword is described in the following sections:
        <ul>
        <li><a class="sectionRef" href="#sets-and-lists"></a>,</li>
        <li><a class="sectionRef" href="#data-indexing"></a>,</li>

  <h1>Basic Concepts</h1>

  <p>JSON [[RFC8259]] is a lightweight, language-independent data interchange format.
    It is easy to parse and easy to generate. However, it is difficult to integrate JSON
    from different sources as the data may contain keys that conflict with other
    data sources. Furthermore, JSON has no
    built-in support for hyperlinks, which are a fundamental building block on
    the Web. Let's start by looking at an example that we will be using for the
    rest of this section:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Sample JSON document">
  <!--
  {
    "name": "Manu Sporny",
    "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/",
    "image": "http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png"
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>It's obvious to humans that the data is about a person whose
    <code>name</code> is "Manu Sporny"
    and that the <code>homepage</code> property contains the URL of that person's homepage.
    A machine doesn't have such an intuitive understanding and sometimes,
    even for humans, it is difficult to resolve ambiguities in such representations. This problem
    can be solved by using unambiguous identifiers to denote the different concepts instead of
    tokens such as "name", "homepage", etc.</p>

  <p>Linked Data, and the Web in general, uses <a>IRIs</a>
    (<a data-cite="RFC3987#section-2">Internationalized Resource Identifiers</a> as described in [[!RFC3987]]) for unambiguous
    identification. The idea is to use <a>IRIs</a>
    to assign unambiguous identifiers to data that may be of use to other developers.
    It is useful for <a>terms</a>,
    like <code>name</code> and <code>homepage</code>, to expand to <a>IRIs</a>
    so that developers don't accidentally step on each other's terms. Furthermore, developers and
    machines are able to use this <a>IRI</a> (by using a web browser, for instance) to go to
    the term and get a definition of what the term means. This process is known as <a>IRI</a>
    dereferencing.</p>

  <p>Leveraging the popular <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org vocabulary</a>,
    the example above could be unambiguously expressed as follows:</p>

  <aside class="example ds-selector-tabs"
         title="Sample JSON-LD document using full IRIs instead of terms">
    <div class="selectors">
      <button class="selected" data-selects="expanded">Expanded</button>
      <button data-selects="statements">Statements</button>
      <button data-selects="turtle">Turtle</button>
      <a class="playground" target="_blank"></a>
    </div>
    <pre class="expanded selected nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample">
    <!--
    {
      "****http://schema.org/name****": "Manu Sporny",
      "****http://schema.org/url****": ****{ "@id": ****"http://manu.sporny.org/" ****}****,  ####← The '@id' keyword means 'This value is an identifier that is an IRI'####
      "****http://schema.org/image****": ****{ "@id": ****"http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png" ****}****
    }
    -->
    </pre>
    <table class="statements"
           data-result-for="Sample JSON-LD document using full IRIs instead of terms-expanded"
           data-to-rdf>

      <tbody>
        <tr><td>_:b0</td><td>schema:image</td><td>http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png</td></tr>
        <tr><td>_:b0</td><td>schema:name</td><td>Manu Sporny</td></tr>
        <tr><td>_:b0</td><td>schema:url</td><td>http://manu.sporny.org/</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <pre class="turtle"
         data-content-type="text/turtle"
         data-result-for="Sample JSON-LD document using full IRIs instead of terms-expanded"
         data-transform="updateExample"
         data-to-rdf>
    <!--
    @prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .
    @prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

     [
       schema:image <http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png>;
       schema:name "Manu Sporny";
       schema:url <http://manu.sporny.org/>
     ] .
    -->
    </pre>
  </aside>

  <p>In the example above, every property is unambiguously identified by an <a>IRI</a> and all values
    representing <a>IRIs</a> are explicitly marked as such by the
    <code>@id</code> <a>keyword</a>. While this is a valid JSON-LD
    document that is very specific about its data, the document is also overly verbose and difficult
    to work with for human developers. To address this issue, JSON-LD introduces the notion
    of a <a>context</a> as described in the next section.</p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>The Context</h2>

    <p>When two people communicate with one another, the conversation takes
    place in a shared environment, typically called
    "the context of the conversation". This shared context allows the
    individuals to use shortcut terms, like the first name of a mutual friend,
    to communicate more quickly but without losing accuracy. A context in
    JSON-LD works in the same way. It allows two applications to use shortcut
    terms to communicate with one another more efficiently, but without
    losing accuracy.</p>

    <p>Simply speaking, a <a>context</a> is used to map <a>terms</a> to
      <a>IRIs</a>. <a>Terms</a> are case sensitive
      and any valid <a>string</a> that is not a reserved JSON-LD <a>keyword</a>
      can be used as a <a>term</a>.</p>

    <p>For the sample document in the previous section, a <a>context</a> would
      look something like this:</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
         data-context-for="Sample JSON document"
         title="Context for the sample document in the previous section">
    <!--
    {
      ****"@context": {
        "name": "http://schema.org/name",****  ####← This means that 'name' is shorthand for 'http://schema.org/name'#### ****
        "image": {
          "@id": "http://schema.org/image",****  ####← This means that 'image' is shorthand for 'http://schema.org/image'#### ****
          "@type": "@id"****  ####← This means that a string value associated with 'image' should be interpreted as an identifier that is an IRI#### ****
        },
        "homepage": {
          "@id": "http://schema.org/url",****  ####← This means that 'homepage' is shorthand for 'http://schema.org/url'#### ****
          "@type": "@id"****  ####← This means that a string value associated with 'homepage' should be interpreted as an identifier that is an IRI#### ****
        }
      }****
    }
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>As the <a>context</a> above shows, the value of a <a>term definition</a> can
      either be a simple string, mapping the <a>term</a> to an <a>IRI</a>,
      or a <a>dictionary</a>.</p>

    <p>When a when a <a>member</a> with a <a>term</a> key has a <a>dictionary</a> value, the <a>dictionary</a> is called
      an <a>expanded term definition</a>. The example above specifies that
      the values of <code>image</code> and <code>homepage</code>, if they are
      strings, are to be interpreted as
      <a>IRIs</a>. <a>Expanded term definitions</a>
      also allow terms to be used for <a href="#data-indexing">index maps</a>
      and to specify whether <a>array</a> values are to be
      interpreted as <a href="#sets">sets</a> or <a href="#lists">lists</a>.
      <a>Expanded term definitions</a> may
      be defined using <a data-lt="absolute IRI">absolute</a> or
      <a>compact IRIs</a> as keys, which is
      mainly used to associate type or language information with an
      <a data-lt="absolute IRI">absolute</a> or <a>compact IRI</a>.</p>

    <p><a>Contexts</a> can either be directly embedded
      into the document or be referenced. Assuming the context document in the previous
      example can be retrieved at <code>https://json-ld.org/contexts/person.jsonld</code>,
      it can be referenced by adding a single line and allows a JSON-LD document to
      be expressed much more concisely as shown in the example below:</p>

    <p>The referenced context not only specifies how the terms map to
      <a>IRIs</a> in the Schema.org vocabulary but also
      specifies that string values associated with
      the <code>homepage</code> and <code>image</code> property
      can be interpreted as an <a>IRI</a> (<code>"@type": "@id"</code>,
      see <a class="sectionRef" href="#iris"></a> for more details). This information allows developers
      to re-use each other's data without having to agree to how their data will interoperate
      on a site-by-site basis. External JSON-LD context documents may contain extra
      information located outside of the <code>@context</code> key, such as
      documentation about the <a>terms</a> declared in the
      document. Information contained outside of the <code>@context</code> value
      is ignored when the document is used as an external JSON-LD context document.</p>

    <p>JSON documents can be interpreted as JSON-LD without having to be modified by
      referencing a <a>context</a> via an <a data-cite="RFC8288#section-3">HTTP Link Header</a>
      as described in <a class="sectionRef" href="#interpreting-json-as-json-ld"></a>. It is also
      possible to apply a custom context using the JSON-LD 1.1 API [[JSON-LD11-API]].</p>

    <p>In <a>JSON-LD documents</a>,
      <a>contexts</a> may also be specified inline.
      This has the advantage that documents can be processed even in the
      absence of a connection to the Web. Ultimately, this is a modeling decision
      and different use cases may require different handling.</p>

  <h2>IRIs</h2>

  <p><a>IRIs</a> (<a data-cite="RFC3987#section-2">Internationalized Resource Identifiers</a>
    [[!RFC3987]]) are fundamental to Linked Data as that is how most
    <a>nodes</a> and <a>properties</a>
    are identified. In JSON-LD, IRIs may be represented as an
    <a>absolute IRI</a> or a <a>relative IRI</a>. An
    <a data-cite="RFC3987#section-1.3">absolute IRI</a> is defined in [[!RFC3987]] as containing a
    <em>scheme</em> along with <em>path</em> and optional <em>query</em> and
    <em>fragment</em> segments. A <a>relative IRI</a> is an IRI
    that is relative to some other <a>absolute IRI</a>.
    In JSON-LD, with exceptions are as described below, all <a>relative IRIs</a>
    are resolved relative to the <a>base IRI</a>.</p>

    that defines them as being relative to the <a>vocabulary mapping</a>,
    may have the form of a <a>relative IRI</a>, but are resolved using the
    <a>vocabulary mapping</a>, and not the <a>base IRI</a>.</p>

  <p>A <a>string</a> is interpreted as an <a>IRI</a> when it is the
    value of an <a>dictionary member</a> with the key<code>@id</code>:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Values of @id are interpreted as IRI">
  <!--
  {
    ####...####
    "homepage": { "****@id****": "http://example.com/" }
    ####...####
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Values that are interpreted as <a>IRIs</a>, can also be
    expressed as <a>relative IRIs</a>. For example,
    assuming that the following document is located at
    <code>http://example.com/about/</code>, the <a>relative IRI</a>
    <code>../</code> would expand to <code>http://example.com/</code> (for more
    information on where  <a>relative IRIs</a> can be
    used, please refer to section <a href="#json-ld-grammar"></a>).</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="IRIs can be relative">
  <!--
  {
    ####...####
    "homepage": { "****@id****": "../" }
    ####...####
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p><a>Absolute IRIs</a> can be expressed directly
    in the key position like so:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="IRI as a key">
  <!--
  {
    ####...####
    "****http://schema.org/name****": "Manu Sporny"####,
    ...####
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>In the example above, the key <code>http://schema.org/name</code>
    is interpreted as an <a>absolute IRI</a>.</p>

  <p>Term-to-IRI expansion occurs if the key matches a <a>term</a> defined
    within the <a>active context</a>:</p>

  <p>In the example above, since the value <code>http://manu.sporny.org/</code>
    is expressed as a JSON <a>string</a>, the type <a>coercion</a>
    rules will transform the value into an IRI when processing the data.
    See <a class="sectionRef" href="#type-coercion"></a> for more
    details about this feature.</p>

  <p>In summary, <a>IRIs</a> can be expressed in a variety of

  <ol>
    <li><a>Dictionary members</a> that have a key mapping to a <a>term</a> in
      the <a>active context</a> expand to an <a>IRI</a>
      (only applies outside of the <a>context definition</a>).</li>
    <li>An <a>IRI</a> is generated for the <a>string</a> value specified using
      <code>@id</code> or <code>@type</code>.</li>
    <li>An <a>IRI</a> is generated for the <a>string</a> value of any key for which there
      are <a>coercion</a> rules that contain an <code>@type</code> key that is
      set to a value of <code>@id</code> or <code>@vocab</code>.</li>

  <h2>Specifying the Type</h2>

  <p>In Linked Data, it is common to specify the type of a graph node;
    in many cases, this can be inferred based on the properties used within a
    given <a>node object</a>, or the property for which a node is a value. For
    example, in the <em>schema.org</em> vocabulary, the <em>givenName</em>
    property is associated with a <em>Person</em>. Therefore, one may reason that
    if a <a>node object</a> contains the property <em>firstName</em>, that the
    type is a <em>Person</em>; making this explicit with <code>@type</code> helps
    to clarify the association.</p>
  
  <p>The type of a particular node can be specified using the <code>@type</code>
    <a>keyword</a>. In Linked Data, types are uniquely
    identified with an <a>IRI</a>.</p>

  <p class="note">This section only covers the most basic features associated with
    types in JSON-LD. It is worth noting that the <code>@type</code>
    <a>keyword</a> is not only used to specify the type of a
    <a>node</a> but also to express <a>typed values</a>
    (as described in <a class="sectionRef" href="#typed-values"></a>) and to
    <a data-lt="coercion">type coerce</a> values (as described in
    <a class="sectionRef" href="#type-coercion"></a>). Specifically, <code>@type</code>
    cannot be used in a <a>context</a> to define a <a>node</a>'s
    type. For a detailed description of the differences, please refer to

<h1>Advanced Concepts</h1>

<p>JSON-LD has a number of features that provide functionality above and beyond
  the core functionality described above. JSON can be used to express data
  using such structures, and the features described in this
  section can be used to interpret a variety of different JSON structures as
  Linked Data. A JSON-LD processor will make use of provided and embedded
  contexts to interpret property values in a number of different idiomatic
  ways.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Describing values</dt>
  <dd><p>One pattern in JSON is for the value of a property to be a string.
    Often times, this string actually represents some other typed value, for
    example an IRI, a date, or a string in some specific language. See <a
    href="#describing-values" class="sectionRef"></a> for details on how to
    describe such value typing.</p></dd>
  <dt>Value ordering</dt>
  <dd><p>In JSON, a property with an array value implies an implicit order;
    arrays in JSON-LD do not provide an ordering of the contained elements by
    default, unless defined using embedded structures or through a context
    definition. See <a href="#sets-and-lists" class="sectionRef"></a> for a
    further discussion.</p></dd>
  <dt>Property nesting</dt>
  <dd><p>Another JSON idiom often found in APIs is to use an
      intermediate object to represent the properties of an object; in JSON-LD
      these are refered to as <a>nested properties</a> and are described in <a
      href="#nested-properties" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p></dd>
  <dt>Referencing objects</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Linked Data is all about describing the relationships between different resources.
      Sometimes these relationships are between resources defined in different
      documents described on the web, sometimes the resources are described
      within the same document.</p>

  <dt>Indexed values</dt>
  <dd><p>Another common idiom in JSON is to use an intermediate object to represent property values via indexing. JSON-LD allows data to be indexed
    in a number of different ways, as detailed in <a href="#indexed-values" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p></dd>
  <dt>Reverse Properties</dt>
  <dd><p>JSON-LD serializes directed <a>graphs</a>. That means that
    every <a>property</a> points from a <a>node</a> to another <a>node</a>
    or <a data-lt="JSON-LD value">value</a>. However, in some cases, it is desirable
    to serialize in the reverse direction, as detailed in <a href="#reverse-properties" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The following sections describe such
  advanced functionality in more detail.</p>

<section class="informative"><h2>Advanced Context Usage</h2>

  <p>Section <a href="#the-context"></a> introduced the basics of what makes
  JSON-LD work. This section expands on the basic principles of the
  <a>context</a> and demonstrates how more advanced use cases can
  be achieved using JSON-LD.</p>

  <p>In general, contexts may be used any time a
    <a>dictionary</a> is defined.
    The only time that one cannot express a context is as a direct child of another context definition (other than as part of an <a>expanded term definition</a>).
    For example, a <a>JSON-LD document</a> may use more than one context at different
    points in a document:</p>

  <p>In the example above, the <code>name</code> <a>term</a> is overridden
    in the more deeply nested <code>details</code> structure. Note that this is
    rarely a good authoring practice and is typically used when working with
    legacy applications that depend on a specific structure of the
    <a>dictionary</a>. If a <a>term</a> is redefined within a
    context, all previous rules associated with the previous definition are
    removed. If a <a>term</a> is redefined to <code>null</code>,
    the <a>term</a> is effectively removed from the list of
    <a>terms</a> defined in the <a>active context</a>.</p>

  <p>Multiple contexts may be combined using an <a>array</a>, which is processed
    in order. The set of contexts defined within a specific <a>dictionary</a> are
    referred to as <a>local contexts</a>. The
    <a>active context</a> refers to the accumulation of
    <a>local contexts</a> that are in scope at a
    specific point within the document. Setting a <a>local context</a>
    to <code>null</code> effectively resets the <a>active context</a>
    to an empty context, without <a>term definitions</a>, <a>default language</a>,
    or other things defined within previous contexts.
    The following example specifies an external context
    and then layers an embedded context on top of the external context:</p>

  <p class="note">When possible, the <a>context</a> definition should be put
    at the top of a JSON-LD document. This makes the document easier to read and
    might make streaming parsers more efficient. Documents that do not have the

  <p class="note">To avoid forward-compatibility issues, <a>terms</a>
    starting with an&nbsp;<code>@</code> character are to be avoided as they
    might be used as <a>keyword</a> in future versions
    of JSON-LD. Terms starting with an&nbsp;<code>@</code> character that are not
    <a data-lt="keyword">JSON-LD 1.1 keywords</a> are treated as any other term, i.e.,
    they are ignored unless mapped to an <a>IRI</a>. Furthermore, the use of
    empty <a>terms</a> (<code>""</code>) is not allowed as
    not all programming languages are able to handle empty JSON keys.</p>

<section class="changed informative"><h2>JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Mode</h2>

  <p>New features defined in JSON-LD 1.1 are available
    when the <a>processing mode</a> is set to <code>json-ld-1.1</code>.
    This may be set using the <code>@version</code> <a>member</a> in a <code>context</code>
    set to the value <code>1.1</code> as a <a>number</a>, or through an API option.</p>

  </pre>

  <p>The first <code>context</code> encountered when processing a

  <p class="note">Setting the <a>processing mode</a> explicitly

<section class="informative"><h2>Default Vocabulary</h2>

  <p>At times, all properties and types may come from the same vocabulary. JSON-LD's

    <h3>Using the Document Base as the Default Vocabulary</h3>
    <p>In some cases, vocabulary terms are defined directly within the document

      <code>json-ld-1.1</code>, the <a>vocabulary mapping</a> in the <a>active
      context</a> can be set to the empty string <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, which causes terms which
      are expanded relative to the vocabulary, such as the keys of <a>node
      objects</a>, to use the <a>base IRI</a> to create <a>absolute
      IRIs</a>.</p>

<section class="informative"><h2>Base IRI</h2>

  <p>JSON-LD allows <a>IRIs</a>
    to be specified in a relative form which is
    resolved against the document base according
    <a data-cite="RFC3986#section-5.1">section 5.1 Establishing a Base URI</a>
    of [[RFC3986]]. The <a>base IRI</a> may be explicitly set with a <a>context</a>
    using the <code>@base</code> keyword.</p>

  <p>For example, if a JSON-LD document was retrieved from <code>http://example.com/document.jsonld</code>,
    relative IRIs would resolve against that IRI:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Use a relative IRI as node identifier">
    <!--
    {
      "@context": {

      },
      ****"@id": ""****,
      "label": "Just a simple document"
    }
    -->
  </pre>

  <p>This document uses an empty <code>@id</code>, which resolves to the document base.
    However, if the document is moved to a different location, the <a>IRI</a> would change.
    To prevent this without having to use an <a>absolute IRI</a>, a <a>context</a>
    may define an <code>@base</code> mapping, to overwrite the <a>base IRI</a> for the document.</p>

<section class="informative"><h2>Compact IRIs</h2>

  <p>A <a>compact IRI</a> is a way of expressing an <a>IRI</a>
    using a <em>prefix</em> and <em>suffix</em> separated by a colon (<code>:</code>).
    The <a>prefix</a> is a <a>term</a> taken from the
    <a>active context</a> and is a short string identifying a
    particular <a>IRI</a> in a JSON-LD document. For example, the
    prefix <code>foaf</code> may be used as a short hand for the
    Friend-of-a-Friend vocabulary, which is identified using the <a>IRI</a>
    <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/</code>. A developer may append
    any of the FOAF vocabulary terms to the end of the prefix to specify a short-hand
    version of the <a>absolute IRI</a> for the vocabulary term. For example,
    <code>foaf:name</code> would be expanded to the IRI
    <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name</code>.</p>

  <p>In the example above, <code>foaf:name</code> expands to the <a>IRI</a>
    <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name</code> and <code>foaf:Person</code> expands
    to <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person</code>.</p>

  <p><a>Prefixes</a> are expanded when the form of the value
    is a <a>compact IRI</a> represented as a <code>prefix:suffix</code>
    combination, the <em>prefix</em> matches a <a>term</a> defined within the
    <a>active context</a>, and the <em>suffix</em> does not begin with two
    slashes&nbsp;(<code>//</code>). The <a>compact IRI</a> is expanded by
    concatenating the <a>IRI</a> mapped to the <em>prefix</em> to the (possibly empty)
    <em>suffix</em>. If the <em>prefix</em> is not defined in the <a>active context</a>,
    or the suffix begins with two slashes (such as in <code>http://example.com</code>),
    the value is interpreted as <a>absolute IRI</a> instead. If the prefix is an
    underscore (<code>_</code>), the value is interpreted as <a>blank node identifier</a>
    instead.</p>

  <p>It's also possible to use compact IRIs within the context as shown in the
    following example:</p>

<section class="informative"><h2>IRI Expansion within a Context</h2>
  <p>In general, normal IRI expansion rules apply
    anywhere an IRI is expected (see <a class="sectionRef" href="#iris"></a>). Within
    a <a>context</a> definition, this can mean that terms defined
    within the context may also be used within that context as long as
    there are no circular dependencies. For example, it is common to use
    the <code>xsd</code> namespace when defining <a>typed values</a>:</p>

<pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="IRI expansion within a context">
<!--
{
  "@context": {
    ****"xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#"****,
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
    "age": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age",
      "@type": ****"xsd:integer"****
    },
    "homepage": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  }####,
  ...####
}
-->
</pre>

<p>In this example, the <code>xsd</code> <a>term</a> is defined
  and used as a <a>prefix</a> for the <code>@type</code> coercion
  of the <code>age</code> property.</p>

<p><a>Terms</a> may also be used when defining the IRI of another
<a>term</a>:</p>

<pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Using a term to define the IRI of another term within a context">
<!--
{
  "@context": {
    ****"foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"****,
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "name": ****"foaf:name"****,
    "age": {
      "@id": ****"foaf:age"****,
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    },
    "homepage": {
      "@id": ****"foaf:homepage"****,
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  }####,
  ...####
}
-->
</pre>

<p><a>Compact IRIs</a>
  and <a>IRIs</a> may be used on the left-hand side of a
  <a>term</a> definition.</p>

<pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Using a compact IRI as a term">
<!--
{
  "@context": {
    ****"foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"****,
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "name": "foaf:name",
    "****foaf:age****": {
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    },
    "****foaf:homepage****": ****{
      "@type": "@id"
    }****
  }####,
  ...####
}
-->
</pre>

<p>
In this example, the <a>compact IRI</a> form is used in two different
ways.
In the first approach, <code>foaf:age</code> declares both the
<a>IRI</a> for the <a>term</a> (using short-form) as well as the
<code>@type</code> associated with the <a>term</a>. In the second
approach, only the <code>@type</code> associated with the <a>term</a> is
specified. The full <a>IRI</a> for
<code>foaf:homepage</code> is determined by looking up the <code>foaf</code>
<a>prefix</a> in the
<a>context</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a>Absolute IRIs</a> may also be used in the key position in a <a>context</a>:
</p>

<pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Associating context definitions with absolute IRIs">
<!--
{
  "@context": {
    "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/",
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "name": "foaf:name",
    "foaf:age": {
      "@id": "foaf:age",
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    },
    "****http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage****": {
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  }####,
  ...####
}
-->
</pre>

<p>In order for the <a>absolute IRI</a> to match above, the <a>absolute IRI</a>
  needs to be used in the <a>JSON-LD document</a>. Also note that <code>foaf:homepage</code>
  will not use the <code>{ "@type": "@id" }</code> declaration because
  <code>foaf:homepage</code> is not the same as <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage</code>.
  That is, <a>terms</a> are looked up in a <a>context</a> using
  direct string comparison before the <a>prefix</a> lookup mechanism is applied.</p>

<p class="note">While it is possible to define a <a>compact IRI</a>, or
  an <a>absolute IRI</a> to expand to some other unrelated <a>IRI</a>
  (for example, <code>foaf:name</code> expanding to
  <code>http://example.org/unrelated#species</code>), such usage is strongly
  discouraged.</p>

<p>The only exception for using terms in the <a>context</a> is that
  circular definitions are not allowed. That is,
  a definition of <em>term1</em> cannot depend on the
  definition of <em>term2</em> if <em>term2</em> also depends on
  <em>term1</em>. For example, the following <a>context</a> definition
  is illegal:</p>
<pre class="illegal-example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
     data-ignore
     title="Illegal circular definition of terms within a context">
<!--
{
  "@context": {
    ****"term1": "term2:foo",
    "term2": "term1:bar"****
  }####,
  ...####
}
-->
</pre>
</section>

<section class="informative changed"><h2>Scoped Contexts</h2>

  <p>An <a>expanded term definition</a> can include a <code>@context</code>
    property, which defines a <a>context</a> (an <dfn>embedded context</dfn>) for <a data-lt="JSON-LD
    value">values</a> of properties defined using that <a>term</a>. This allows
    values to use <a>term definitions</a>, <a>base IRI</a>,
    <a>vocabulary mapping</a> or <a>default language</a> which is different from the
    <a>node object</a> they are contained in, as if the

  <p>Scoping on <code>@type</code> is useful when common properties are used to
    relate things of different types, where the vocabularies in use within
    different entities calls for different context scoping. For example,
    <code>hasPart</code>/<code>partOf</code> may be common terms used in a document, but mean
    different things depending on the context.</p>

  <p>When expanding, each value of <code>@type</code> is considered
    (ordering them lexographically) where that value is also a <a>term</a> in
    the <a>active context</a> having its own <a>embedded context</a>. If so, that
    <a>embedded context</a> is applied to the <a>active context</a>. When compacting, if
    a <a>term</a> is chosen to represent an IRI used as a value of <code>@type</code> where that
    <a>term definition</a> also has an <a>embedded context</a>, it is then applied to the
    <a>active context</a> to affect further compaction.</p>

  <p class="note">The values of <code>@type</code> are unordered, so if multiple
    types are listed, the order that scoped contexts are applied is based on
    lexicographical ordering.</p>

  <p class="note">If a <a>term</a> defines a scoped context, and then that term
    is later re-defined, the association of the context defined in the earlier
    <a>expanded term definition</a> is lost
    within the scope of that re-definition. This is consistent with
    <a>term definitions</a> of a term overriding previous term definitions from
    earlier less deeply nested definitions, as discussed in
    <a href="#advanced-context-usage" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>

  <p class="note">Scoped Contexts are a new feature in JSON-LD 1.1, requiring
    <a>processing mode</a> set to <code>json-ld-1.1</code>.</p>

<section class="informative"><h2>Describing Values</h2>
  <p>Values are leaf nodes in a graph associated with scalar values such as

<section class="informative"><h2>Typed Values</h2>

<p>A value with an associated type, also known as a
  <a>typed value</a>, is indicated by associating a value with
  an <a>IRI</a> which indicates the value's type. Typed values may be
  expressed in JSON-LD in three ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>By utilizing the <code>@type</code> <a>keyword</a> when defining
    a <a>term</a> within an <code>@context</code> section.</li>
  <li>By utilizing a <a>value object</a>.</li>
  <li>By using a native JSON type such as <a>number</a>, <a>true</a>, or <a>false</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first example uses the <code>@type</code> keyword to associate a
type with a particular <a>term</a> in the <code>@context</code>:</p>

<p>Both examples above would generate the value
  <code>2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00</code> with the type
  <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime</code>. Note that it is
  also possible to use a <a>term</a> or a <a>compact IRI</a> to
  express the value of a type.</p>

<p class="note">The <code>@type</code> <a>keyword</a> is also used to associate a type
  with a <a>node</a>. The concept of a <a>node type</a> and
  a <a>value type</a> are different.</p>

<p>A <dfn>node type</dfn> specifies the type of thing
  that is being described, like a person, place, event, or web page. A
  <dfn>value type</dfn> specifies the data type of a particular value, such
  as an integer, a floating point number, or a date.</p>

<section class="informative"><h2>Type Coercion</h2>

<p>JSON-LD supports the coercion of values to particular data types.
Type <dfn>coercion</dfn> allows someone deploying JSON-LD to coerce the incoming or
outgoing values to the proper data type based on a mapping of data type <a>IRIs</a> to
<a>terms</a>. Using type coercion, value representation is preserved without requiring
the data type to be specified with each piece of data.</p>

<p>Type coercion is specified within an <a>expanded term definition</a>
  using the <code>@type</code> key. The value of this key expands to an <a>IRI</a>.
  Alternatively, the <a>keyword</a> <code>@id</code> or <code>@vocab</code> may be used
  as value to indicate that within the body of a JSON-LD document, a <a>string</a> value of a
  <a>term</a> coerced to <code>@id</code> or <code>@vocab</code> is to be interpreted as an
  <a>IRI</a>. The difference between <code>@id</code> and <code>@vocab</code> is how values are expanded
  to <a>absolute IRIs</a>. <code>@vocab</code> first tries to expand the value
  by interpreting it as <a>term</a>. If no matching <a>term</a> is found in the
  <a>active context</a>, it tries to expand it as <a>compact IRI</a> or <a>absolute IRI</a>
  if there's a colon in the value; otherwise, it will expand the value using the
  <a data-lt="active context">active context's</a> <a>vocabulary mapping</a>, if present.
  Values coerced to <code>@id</code> in contrast are expanded as
  <a>compact IRI</a> or <a>absolute IRI</a> if a colon is present; otherwise, they are interpreted
  as <a>relative IRI</a>.</p>

<p><a>Terms</a> or <a>compact IRIs</a> used as the value of a
  <code>@type</code> key may be defined within the same context. This means that one may specify a
  <a>term</a> like <code>xsd</code> and then use <code>xsd:integer</code> within the same
  context definition.</p>

<p>The example below demonstrates how a JSON-LD author can coerce values to
<a>typed values</a> and <a>IRIs</a>.</p>

<p>In this case the <code>@id</code> definition in the term definition is optional.
  If it does exist, the <a>compact IRI</a> or <a>IRI</a> representing
  the term will always be expanded to <a>IRI</a> defined by the <code>@id</code>
  key&mdash;regardless of whether a prefix is defined or not.</p>

<p>Type coercion is always performed using the unexpanded value of the key. In the
  example above, that means that type coercion is done looking for <code>foaf:age</code>
  in the <a>active context</a> and not for the corresponding, expanded
  <a>IRI</a> <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age</code>.</p>

<p class="note">Keys in the context are treated as <a>terms</a> for the purpose of
  expansion and value coercion. At times, this may result in multiple representations for the same expanded IRI.
  For example, one could specify that <code>dog</code> and <code>cat</code> both expanded to <code>http://example.com/vocab#animal</code>.
  Doing this could be useful for establishing different type coercion or language specification rules. It also allows a <a>compact IRI</a> (or even an
  absolute <a>IRI</a>) to be defined as something else entirely. For example, one could specify that
  the <a>term</a> <code>http://example.org/zoo</code> should expand to
  <code>http://example.org/river</code>, but this usage is discouraged because it would lead to a
  great deal of confusion among developers attempting to understand the JSON-LD document.</p>

<section class="informative"><h2>String Internationalization</h2>

  <p>At times, it is important to annotate a <a>string</a>
    with its language. In JSON-LD this is possible in a variety of ways.
    First, it is possible to define a <a>default language</a> for a JSON-LD document
    by setting the <code>@language</code> key in the <a>context</a>:</p>

  <aside class="example ds-selector-tabs changed"

    -->
    </pre>
  </aside>

  <p>The example above would associate the <code>ja</code> language
    code with the two <a>strings</a> <em>花澄</em> and <em>科学者</em>.
    <a data-cite="BCP47#section-2">Languages codes</a> are defined in [[!BCP47]]. The <a>default language</a> applies to all
    <a>string</a> values that are not <a href="#type-coercion">type coerced</a>.</p>

  <p>To clear the <a>default language</a> for a subtree, <code>@language</code> can
    be set to <code>null</code> in a <a>local context</a> as follows:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Clearing default language">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      ####...####
      "@language": "ja"
    },
    "name": "花澄",
    "details": {
      ****"@context": {
        "@language": null
      }****,
      "occupation": "Ninja"
    }
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Second, it is possible to associate a language with a specific <a>term</a>
    using an <a>expanded term definition</a>:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Expanded term definition with language">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      ####...####
      "ex": "http://example.com/vocab/",
      "@language": "ja",
      "name": { "@id": "ex:name", ****"@language": null**** },
      "occupation": { "@id": "ex:occupation" },
      "occupation_en": { "@id": "ex:occupation", ****"@language": "en"**** },
      "occupation_cs": { "@id": "ex:occupation", ****"@language": "cs"**** }
    },
    ****"name": "Yagyū Muneyoshi",
    "occupation": "忍者",
    "occupation_en": "Ninja",
    "occupation_cs": "Nindža"****####,
    ...####
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>The example above would associate <em>忍者</em> with the specified default
    language code <code>ja</code>, <em>Ninja</em> with the language code
    <code>en</code>, and <em>Nindža</em> with the language code <code>cs</code>.
    The value of <code>name</code>, <em>Yagyū Muneyoshi</em> wouldn't be
    associated with any language code since <code>@language</code> was reset to
    <a>null</a> in the <a>expanded term definition</a>.</p>

  <p class="note">Language associations are only applied to plain
    <a>strings</a>. <a>Typed values</a>
    or values that are subject to <a href="#type-coercion">type coercion</a>
    are not language tagged.</p>

  <p>Just as in the example above, systems often need to express the value of a
    property in multiple languages. Typically, such systems also try to ensure that
    developers have a programmatically easy way to navigate the data structures for
    the language-specific data. In this case, <a>language maps</a>
    may be utilized.</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Language map expressing a property in three languages">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      ####...####
      "occupation": { "@id": "ex:occupation", ****"@container": "@language"**** }
    },
    "name": "Yagyū Muneyoshi",
    "occupation": ****{
      "ja": "忍者",
      "en": "Ninja",
      "cs": "Nindža"
    }****
    ####...####
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>The example above expresses exactly the same information as the previous
    example but consolidates all values in a single property. To access the
    value in a specific language in a programming language supporting dot-notation
    accessors for object properties, a developer may use the
    <code>property.language</code> pattern. For example, to access the occupation
    in English, a developer would use the following code snippet:
    <code>obj.occupation.en</code>.</p>

  <p>Third, it is possible to override the <a>default language</a> by using a
    <a>value object</a>:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Overriding default language using an expanded value">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      ####...####
      "@language": "ja"
    },
    "name": "花澄",
    "occupation": ****{
      "@value": "Scientist",
      "@language": "en"
    }****
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>This makes it possible to specify a plain string by omitting the
    <code>@language</code> tag or setting it to <code>null</code> when expressing
    it using a <a>value object</a>:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Removing language information using an expanded value">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      ####...####
      "@language": "ja"
    },
    "name": ****{
      "@value": "Frank"
    }****,
    "occupation": {
      "@value": "Ninja",
      "@language": "en"
    },
    "speciality": "手裏剣"
  }
  -->

    of using <a>language maps</a> to set the language of mapped values.</p>
</section>

</section>

<section class="informative" id="sets-and-lists"><h2>Value Ordering</h2>

<p>A JSON-LD author can express multiple values in a compact way by using
  <a>arrays</a>. Since graphs do not describe ordering for links
  between nodes, arrays in JSON-LD do not provide an ordering of the

<p>The implementation of <a>lists</a> in RDF depends on linking anonymous nodes
  together using the properties <code>rdf:first</code> and
  <code>rdf:rest</code>, with the end of the list defined as the resource
  <code>rdf:nil</code>. This can be represented as statments, as the "statements"
  tab illustrates.</p>


<p>Both JSON-LD and Turtle provide shortcuts for representing ordered lists.</p>

<p class="changed">In JSON-LD 1.1, lists of lists, where the value of
  a <a>list object</a>, may itself be a <a>list object</a>, are
  fully supported. For example, in <a data-cite="RFC7946">GeoJSON</a> (see [[RFC7946]]),
  <em>coordinates</em> are an ordered list of <em>positions</em>, which are
  represented as an array of two or more numbers:</p>

<pre class="example changed nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
     data-content-type="application/json"
     title="Coordinates expressed in GeoJSON">
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "bbox": [-10.0, -10.0, 10.0, 10.0],
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [
        [
            [-10.0, -10.0],
            [10.0, -10.0],
            [10.0, 10.0],
            [-10.0, -10.0]
        ]
    ]
  }
  ####//...####
}
</pre>

<p class="changed">For these examples, it's important that values
  expressed within <em>bbox</em> and <em>coordinates</em> maintain their order,
  which requires the use of embedded list structures. In JSON-LD 1.1, we can
  express this using recursive lists, by simply adding the appropriate context
  definion:</p>

<section class="informative"><h2>Sets</h2>

<p>While <code>@list</code> is used to describe <em>ordered lists</em>,
  the <code>@set</code> keyword is used to describe <em>unordered sets</em>.
  The use of <code>@set</code> in the body of a JSON-LD document
  is optimized away when processing the document, as it is just syntactic
  sugar. However, <code>@set</code> is helpful when used within the context
  of a document.
  Values of terms associated with an <code>@set</code> container
  are always represented in the form of an <a>array</a>,
  even if there is just a single value that would otherwise be optimized to
  a non-array form in compact form (see
  <a class="sectionRef" href="#compacted-document-form"></a>). This makes post-processing of
  JSON-LD documents easier as the data is always in array form, even if the
  array only contains a single value.</p>

  <p>A <a>node object</a>, like the one used above, may be used in
    any value position in the body of a JSON-LD document. Note that <a

    is not required, as the value is not a string.</p>


  <p>While it is considered a best practice to identify nodes in a graph,
    at times this is impractical. In the data model, nodes without an explicit
    identifier are called <a>blank nodes</a>, which can be represented in a
    serialization such as JSON-LD using a <a>blank node identifier</a>. In the
    previous example, the top-level node for Manu does not have an identifier,
    and does not need one to describe it within the data model. However, if we
    were to want to describe a <em>knows</em> relationship from Gregg to Manu,
    we would need to introduce a <a>blank node identifier</a>
    (here <code>_:b0</code>).</p>

  <p><a>Blank node identifiers</a> may be automatically introduced by algorithms such as <a>flattening</a>, but they are also useful for authors to describe such relationships directly.</p>

<section class="informative"><h2>Identifying Blank Nodes</h2>

  <p>At times, it becomes necessary to be able to express information without
    being able to uniquely identify the <a>node</a> with an <a>IRI</a>.
    This type of node is called a <a>blank node</a>. JSON-LD does not require
    all nodes to be identified using <code>@id</code>. However, some graph topologies
    may require identifiers to be serializable. Graphs containing loops, e.g., cannot
    be serialized using <a>embedding</a> alone, <code>@id</code> must be used to connect the nodes.
    In these situations, one can use <a>blank node identifiers</a>,
    which look like <a>IRIs</a> using an underscore (<code>_</code>)
    as scheme. This allows one to reference the node locally within the document, but
    makes it impossible to reference the node from an external document. The
    <a>blank node identifier</a> is scoped to the document in which it is used.</p>

  <p>The example above contains information about two secret agents that cannot be identified
    with an <a>IRI</a>. While expressing that <em>agent&nbsp;1</em> knows <em>agent&nbsp;2</em>
    is possible without using <a>blank node identifiers</a>,
    it is necessary to assign <em>agent&nbsp;1</em> an identifier so that it can be referenced
    from <em>agent&nbsp;2</em>.</p>
  <p>It is worth noting that blank node identifiers may be relabeled during processing.
    If a developer finds that they refer to the <a>blank node</a> more than once,
    they should consider naming the node using a dereferenceable <a>IRI</a> so that
    it can also be referenced from other documents.</p>

<section class="informative"><h2>Indexed Values</h2>

<p>Sometimes multiple property values need to be accessed
  in a more direct fashion than iterating though multiple array values. JSON-LD
  provides an indexing mechanism to allow the use of an intermediate dictionary
  to associate specific indexes with associated values.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Data Indexing</dt><dd>As described in <a href="#data-indexing" class="sectionRef"></a>,
    data indexing allows an arbitrary to reference a <a>node</a> or value.</dd>
  <dt>Language Indexing</dt><dd>As described in <a href="#language-indexing" class="sectionRef"></a>,
    language indexing allows a language to reference a <a>string</a> and be
    interpreted as the language associated with that string.</dd>
  <dt>Node Identifier Indexing</dt><dd>As described in <a href="#node-identifier-indexing" class="sectionRef"></a>,
    node indentifier indexing allows an <a>IRI</a> to reference a <a>node</a>
    and be interpreted as the identifier of that <a>node</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Node Type Indexing</dt><dd>As described in <a href="#node-type-indexing" class="sectionRef"></a>,
    node type indexing allows an <a>IRI</a> to reference a <a>node</a>
    and be interpreted as a type of that <a>node</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>See <a href="#named-graphs" class="sectionRef"></a> for other uses of indexing in JSON-LD.</p>

<section class="informative"><h2>Data Indexing</h2>

  <p>Databases are typically used to make access to
    data more efficient. Developers often extend this sort of functionality into
    their application data to deliver similar performance gains. Often this
    data does not have any meaning from a Linked Data standpoint, but is
    still useful for an application.</p>

  <p>JSON-LD introduces the notion of <a>index maps</a>
    that can be used to structure data into a form that is
    more efficient to access. The data indexing feature allows an author to
    structure data using a simple key-value map where the keys do not map
    to <a>IRIs</a>. This enables direct access to data
    instead of having to scan an array in search of a specific item.
    In JSON-LD such data can be specified by associating the
    <code>@index</code> <a>keyword</a> with a
    <code>@container</code> declaration in the context:</p>

</section>
<section class="informative changed"><h2>Node Type Indexing</h2>

  <p>In addition to <a data-lt="id map">id</a> and <a>index maps</a>, JSON-LD introduces the notion of <a>type maps</a>
    for structuring data. The type indexing feature allows an author to
    structure data using a simple key-value map where the keys map
    to <a>IRIs</a>. This enables data to be structured based on the <code>@type</code>
    of specific <a>node objects</a>.
    In JSON-LD such data can be specified by associating the
    <code>@type</code> <a>keyword</a> with a
    <code>@container</code> declaration in the context:</p>

  <p>As with <a>id maps</a>, when used with <code>@type</code>, a container may also
    include <code>@set</code> to ensure that key values are always contained in an array.</p>

  <p class="note"><a>Type maps</a> are a new feature in JSON-LD 1.1, requiring

<section class="informative"><h2>Reverse Properties</h2>

  <p>JSON-LD serializes directed <a>graphs</a>. That means that
    every <a>property</a> points from a <a>node</a> to another <a>node</a>
    or <a data-lt="JSON-LD value">value</a>. However, in some cases, it is desirable
    to serialize in the reverse direction. Consider for example the case where a person
    and its children should be described in a document. If the used vocabulary does not
    provide a <em>children</em> <a>property</a> but just a <em>parent</em>
    <a>property</a>, every <a>node</a> representing a child would have to
    be expressed with a <a>property</a> pointing to the parent as in the following
    example.</p>

  <p>The example above expresses a <a>named graph</a> that is identified
    by the <a>IRI</a> <code>http://example.org/foaf-graph</code>. That
    graph is composed of the statements about Manu and Gregg. Metadata about
    the graph itself is expressed via the <code>generatedAt</code> property,
    which specifies when the graph was generated.</p>

  <p>When a JSON-LD document's top-level structure is an
    <a>dictionary</a> that contains no other
    keys than <code>@graph</code> and
    optionally <code>@context</code> (properties that are not mapped to an
    <a>IRI</a> or a <a>keyword</a> are ignored),
    <code>@graph</code> is considered to express the otherwise implicit
    <a>default graph</a>. This mechanism can be useful when a number
    of <a>nodes</a> exist at the document's top level that
    share the same <a>context</a>, which is, e.g., the case when a
    document is <a href="#flattened-document-form">flattened</a>. The
    <code>@graph</code> keyword collects such nodes in an <a>array</a>
    and allows the use of a shared context.</p>

    <h3>Graph Containers</h3>
    <p>In some cases, it is useful to logically partition data into separate
      graphs, without making this explicit within the JSON expression. For
      example, a JSON document may contain data against which other metadata is
      asserted and it is useful to separate this data in the data model using
      the notion of <a>named graphs</a>, without the syntactic overhead
      associated with the <code>@graph</code> keyword.</p>

    <p>An <a>expanded term definition</a> can use <code>@graph</code> as the
      value of <code>@container</code>. This indicates that values of this
      <a>term</a> should be considered to be <a>named graphs</a>, where the
      <a>graph name</a> is an automatically assigned <a>blank node identifier</a>
      creating an <a>implicitly named graph</a>. When expanded, these become
      <a>simple graph objects</a>.</p>

   <p>An alternative to our example above could use an anonymously <a>named graph</a>
      as follows:</p>

      such as the named graph in this case, can be represented.</p>

    <p class="note">Strictly speaking, the value of such a <a>term</a>
      is not a <a>named graph</a>, rather it is the <a>graph name</a>
      associated with the <a>named graph</a>, which exists separately within
      the <a>dataset</a>.</p>

      <a>processing mode</a> set to <code>json-ld-1.1</code>.</p>

<section class="informative changed"><h3>Named Graph Data Indexing</h3>

  <p>In addition to indexing <a>node objects</a> by index, <a>graph objects</a> may
    also be indexed by an index. By using the <code>@graph</code>
    container type, introduced in <a href="#graph-containers" class="sectionRef"></a>
    in addition to <code>@index</code>, an object value of such a property is
    treated as a key-value map where the keys do not map to <a>IRIs</a>, but
    are taken from an <code>@index</code> property associated with <a>named graphs</a>
    which are their values. When expanded, these must be <a>simple graph objects</a></p>

  <p>The following example describes a <a>default graph</a> referencing multiple named
    graphs using an <a>index map</a>.</p>

  <p>The JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD11-API]] defines
    a method for <em>compacting</em> a JSON-LD document. <dfn data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#dfn-compact">Compaction</dfn> is the process
    of applying a developer-supplied <a>context</a> to shorten <a>IRIs</a>
    to <a>terms</a> or <a>compact IRIs</a>
    and JSON-LD values expressed in expanded form to simple values such as
    <a>strings</a> or <a>numbers</a>.
    Often this makes it simpler to work with document as the data is expressed in
    application-specific terms. Compacted documents are also typically easier to read
    for humans.</p>

  <p>For example, assume the following JSON-LD input document:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Sample expanded JSON-LD document">
  <!--
  [
    {
      "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [ "Manu Sporny" ],

         "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Additionally, assume the following developer-supplied JSON-LD context:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Sample context"
       data-context-for="Sample expanded JSON-LD document">

        "@type": "@id"
      }
    }
  }

<section class="informative"><h3>Flattened Document Form</h3>

  <p>The JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD11-API]] defines
    a method for <em>flattening</em> a JSON-LD document.
    <dfn data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#dfn-flattened" data-lt="flattened">Flattening</dfn> collects all
    properties of a <a>node</a> in a single <a>dictionary</a> and labels
    all <a>blank nodes</a> with
    <a>blank node identifiers</a>.
    This ensures a shape of the data and consequently may drastically simplify the code
    required to process JSON-LD in certain applications.</p>

  <p>For example, assume the following JSON-LD input document:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"

  </pre>

  <p>Running the JSON-LD <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#flattening-algorithm">Flattening algorithm</a> against the JSON-LD input document in

<section class="informative"><h3>Framed Document Form</h3>

  <p>The JSON-LD 1.1 Framing specification [[JSON-LD11-FRAMING]] defines
    a method for <em>framing</em> a JSON-LD document. <dfn
    data-cite="JSON-LD11-FRAMING#dfn-framing">Framing</dfn> is used to shape
    the data in a JSON-LD document, using an example <a>frame</a> document
    which is used to both match the <a>flattened</a> data and show an example
    of how the resulting data should be shaped.</p>

  <p>For example, assume the following JSON-LD frame:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Sample library frame">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      "@version": 1.1,

    "@type": "Library",
    "contains": {
      "@type": "Book",
      "contains": {
        "@type": "Chapter"
      }
    }
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>This <a>frame</a> document describes an embedding structure that would place
    objects with type <em>Library</em> at the top, with objects of
    type <em>Book</em> that were linked to the library object using
    the <em>contains</em> property embedded as property values. It also
    places objects of type <em>Chapter</em> within the referencing <em>Book</em> object
    as embedded values of the <em>Book</em> object.</p>

  <p>When using a flattened set of objects that match the frame components:</p>
  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Flattened library objects">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      "@vocab": "http://example.org/",
      "contains": {"@type": "@id"}
    },
    "@graph": [{
      "@id": "http://example.org/library",
      "@type": "Library",
      "contains": "http://example.org/library/the-republic"
    }, {
      "@id": "http://example.org/library/the-republic",
      "@type": "Book",
      "creator": "Plato",
      "title": "The Republic",
      "contains": "http://example.org/library/the-republic#introduction"

      "@type": "Chapter",
      "description": "An introductory chapter on The Republic.",
      "title": "The Introduction"
    }]
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>The Frame Algorithm can create a new document which follows the structure
    of the frame:</p>
  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Framed library objects"
       data-frame="Sample library frame"

<section class="normative"><h2>Interpreting JSON as JSON-LD</h2>

  <p>Ordinary JSON documents can be interpreted as JSON-LD
    by providing an explicit JSON-LD <a>context</a> document. One way
    to provide this is by using referencing a JSON-LD
    <a>context</a> document in an <a data-cite="RFC8288#section-3">HTTP Link Header</a>.
    Doing so allows JSON to be unambiguously machine-readable without requiring developers to drastically
    change their documents and provides an upgrade path for existing infrastructure
    without breaking existing clients that rely on the <code>application/json</code>
    media type or a media type with a <code>+json</code> suffix as defined in
    [[!RFC6839]].</p>

  <p>In order to use an external context with an ordinary JSON document,
    when retrieving an ordinary JSON document via HTTP, processors MUST
    retrieve any <a>JSON-LD document</a> referenced by a
    <a data-cite="RFC8288#section-3">Link Header</a> with:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"</code>, and</li>
    <li><code>type="application/ld+json"</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The referenced document MUST have a top-level <a>JSON object</a>.
    The <code>@context</code> <a>member</a> within that object is added to the top-level
    <a>JSON object</a> of the referencing document. If an <a>array</a>
    is at the top-level of the referencing document and its items are
    <a>JSON objects</a>, the <code>@context</code>
    subtree is added to all <a>array</a> items. All extra information located outside
    of the <code>@context</code> subtree in the referenced document MUST be
    discarded. Effectively this means that the <a>active context</a> is
    initialized with the referenced external <a>context</a>. A response MUST NOT
    contain more than one <a data-cite="RFC8288#section-3">HTTP Link Header</a> [[!RFC8288]] using the
    <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context</code> link relation.</p>

  <p>Other mechanisms for providing a JSON-LD Context MAY be described for other

  <p>The JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD11-API]]
    provides for an <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#dom-jsonldoptions-expandcontext">expandContext</a> option for specifying
    a <a>context</a> to use when expanding JSON documents programatically.</p>

  <p>The following example demonstrates the use of an external context with an
    ordinary JSON document over HTTP:</p>

  <p>Please note that <a>JSON-LD documents</a>

  <p>HTML <a data-cite="HTML52/semantics-scripting.html#the-script-element">script elements</a> can be used to embed blocks of data in documents.
    This way, JSON-LD content can be easily embedded in HTML [[HTML52]] by placing

  <h1>Data Model</h1>

  <p>JSON-LD is a serialization format for Linked Data based on JSON.
    It is therefore important to distinguish between the syntax, which is
    defined by JSON in [[!RFC8259]], and the <dfn>data model</dfn> which is
    an extension of the <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#data-model">RDF data model</a> [[!RDF11-CONCEPTS]]. The precise
    details of how JSON-LD relates to the RDF data model are given in
    <a class="sectionRef" href="#relationship-to-rdf"></a>.</p>

  <p>To ease understanding for developers unfamiliar with the RDF model, the
    following summary is provided:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <a>JSON-LD document</a> serializes a
      <a>generalized RDF Dataset</a>
      [[!RDF11-CONCEPTS]], which is a collection of <a>graphs</a>
      that comprises exactly one <a>default graph</a>
      and zero or more <a>named graphs</a>.</li>
    <li>The <a>default graph</a> does not have a name and MAY be empty.</li>
    <li>Each <a>named graph</a> is a pair consisting of an <a>IRI</a> or
      <a>blank node identifier</a> (the
      <a>graph name</a>)
      and a <a>graph</a>. Whenever practical, the <a>graph name</a> SHOULD be an <a>IRI</a>.</li>
    <li>A <a>graph</a>
      is a labeled directed graph, i.e., a set of <a>nodes</a>
      connected by <a>edges</a>.</li>
    <li>Every <a>edge</a> has a direction associated with it and is labeled with
      an <a>IRI</a> or a <a>blank node identifier</a>. Within the JSON-LD syntax
      these edge labels are called <a>properties</a>.
      Whenever practical, an <a>edge</a> SHOULD be labeled with an <a>IRI</a>.</li>
    <li>Every <a>node</a>
      is an <a>IRI</a>, a <a>blank node</a>, a <a>JSON-LD value</a>,
      or a <a>list</a>.</li>
    <li>A <a>node</a> having an outgoing edge MUST be an <a>IRI</a> or a
      <a>blank node</a>.</li>
    <li>A <a>graph</a> MUST NOT contain unconnected <a>nodes</a>,
      i.e., nodes which are not connected by an <a>edge</a> to any other <a>node</a>.

        properties are defined, or the <a>node</a> is referenced from another <a>node object</a>.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>An <a>IRI</a> (Internationalized Resource Identifier) is a string that conforms to the syntax
      defined in [[RFC3987]]. <a>IRIs</a> used within a
      <a>graph</a> SHOULD return a Linked Data document describing
      the resource denoted by that <a>IRI</a> when being dereferenced.</li>
    <li>A <a>blank node</a> is a <a>node</a> which is neither an <a>IRI</a>,
      nor a <a>JSON-LD value</a>, nor a <a>list</a>. A blank node MAY be identified

      the scope of a <a>JSON-LD document</a>. Blank node identifiers begin with
      <code>_:</code>.</li>
    <li>A <a>JSON-LD value</a> is a <a>typed value</a>, a <a>string</a> (which is interpreted
      as <a>typed value</a> with type <code>xsd:string</code>), a <a>number</a>
      (<a>numbers</a> with a non-zero fractional part, i.e., the result of a modulo&#8209;1 operation,

    <li>A <a>language-tagged string</a>

    that cannot be represented by the <a>data model</a>
    defined above. Unless otherwise specified, such data is ignored when a
    <a>JSON-LD document</a> is being processed. One result of this rule
    is that properties which are not mapped to an <a>IRI</a>,
    a <a>blank node</a>, or <a>keyword</a> will be ignored.</p>

  <h1>JSON-LD Grammar</h1>

  <p>This appendix restates the syntactic conventions described in the
    previous sections more formally.</p>

  <p>A <a>JSON-LD document</a> MUST be valid <a data-cite="RFC8259#section-2">JSON text</a> as described
    in [[!RFC8259]], <span class="changed">or some format that can be represented
      in the <a>JSON-LD internal representation</a> that is equivalent to
      valid <a data-cite="RFC8259#section-2">JSON text</a></span>.</p>

  <p>A <a>JSON-LD document</a> MUST be a single <a>node object</a>,
    a <a>dictionary</a> consisting of only
    the <a>members</a> <code>@context</code> and/or <code>@graph</code>,
    or an <a>array</a> or zero or more <a>node objects</a>.</p>

  <p>In contrast to JSON, in JSON-LD the keys in <a data-lt="JSON object">objects</a>
    MUST be unique.</p>

  <p>Whenever a <a>keyword</a> is discussed in this grammar,
    the statements also apply to an alias for that <a>keyword</a>.</p>

  <p class="note">JSON-LD allows <a>keywords</a> to be aliased
    (see <a class="sectionRef" href="#aliasing-keywords"></a> for details). For example, if the <a>active context</a>
    defines the <a>term</a> <code>id</code> as an alias for <code>@id</code>,
    that alias may be legitimately used as a substitution for <code>@id</code>.
    Note that <a>keyword</a> aliases are not expanded during context
    processing.</p>

  <section class="normative">
    <h2>Terms</h2>

    <p>A <a>term</a> is a short-hand <a>string</a> that expands
      to an <a>IRI</a> or a <a>blank node identifier</a>.</p>

    <p>A <a>term</a> MUST NOT equal any of the JSON-LD
      <a>keywords</a>.</p>

    <p class="changed">When used as the <a>prefix</a> in a <a>Compact IRI</a>, to avoid
      the potential ambiguity of a <a>prefix</a> being confused with an IRI
      scheme, <a>terms</a> SHOULD NOT come from the list of URI schemes as defined in
      [[!IANA-URI-SCHEMES]]. Similarly, to avoid confusion between a
      <a>Compact IRI</a> and a <a>term</a>, terms SHOULD NOT include a colon (<code>:</code>)
      and SHOULD be restricted to the form of
      <code><a data-cite="RFC3987#section-2.2">isegment-nz-nc</a></code>
      as defined in [[!RFC3987]].</p>

    <p>To avoid forward-compatibility issues, a <a>term</a> SHOULD NOT start
      with an <code>@</code> character as future versions of JSON-LD may introduce
      additional <a>keywords</a>. Furthermore, the term MUST NOT
      be an empty <a>string</a> (<code>""</code>) as not all programming languages
      are able to handle empty JSON keys.</p>

    <p>See <a class="sectionRef" href="#the-context"></a> and
      <a class="sectionRef" href="#iris"></a> for further discussion
      on mapping <a>terms</a> to <a>IRIs</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="normative">
    <h2>Node Objects</h2>

    <p>A <a>node object</a> represents zero or more properties of a
      <a>node</a> in the <a>graph</a> serialized by the
      <a>JSON-LD document</a>. A <a>dictionary</a> is a
      <a>node object</a> if it exists outside of a JSON-LD
      <a>context</a> and:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>it is not the top-most <a>dictionary</a> in the JSON-LD document consisting
        of no other <a>members</a> than <code>@graph</code> and <code>@context</code>,</li>
      <li>it does not contain the <code>@value</code>, <code>@list</code>,
        or <code>@set</code> keywords, and</li>
      <li class="changed">it is not a <a>graph object</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <a>properties</a> of a <a>node</a> in
      a <a>graph</a> may be spread among different
      <a>node objects</a> within a document. When
      that happens, the keys of the different
      <a>node objects</a> need to be merged to create the
      properties of the resulting <a>node</a>.</p>

    <p>A <a>node object</a> MUST be a <a>dictionary</a>. All keys
      which are not <a>IRIs</a>, <a>compact IRIs</a>, <a>terms</a> valid in the
      <a>active context</a>, or one of the following <a>keywords</a>
      <span class="changed">(or alias of such a keyword)</span>
      MUST be ignored when processed:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>@context</code>,</li>
      <li><code>@id</code>,</li>
      <li><code>@graph</code>,</li>
      <li class="changed"><code>@nest</code>,</li>
      <li><code>@type</code>,</li>
      <li><code>@reverse</code>, or</li>
      <li><code>@index</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the <a>node object</a> contains the <code>@context</code>
      key, its value MUST be <a>null</a>, an <a>absolute IRI</a>,
      a <a>relative IRI</a>, a <a>context definition</a>, or
      an <a>array</a> composed of any of these.</p>

    <p>If the <a>node object</a> contains the <code>@id</code> key,
      its value MUST be an <a>absolute IRI</a>, a <a>relative IRI</a>,
      or a <a>compact IRI</a> (including
      <a>blank node identifiers</a>).
      See <a class="sectionRef" href="#node-identifiers"></a>,
      <a class="sectionRef" href="#compact-iris"></a>, and
      <a class="sectionRef" href="#identifying-blank-nodes"></a> for further discussion on
      <code>@id</code> values.</p>

    <p>If the <a>node object</a> contains the <code>@graph</code>
      key, its value MUST be
      a <a>node object</a> or
      an <a>array</a> of zero or more <a>node objects</a>.
      If the <a>node object</a> contains an <code>@id</code> keyword,
      its value is used as the <a>graph name</a> of a <a>named graph</a>.
      See <a class="sectionRef" href="#named-graphs"></a> for further discussion on
      <code>@graph</code> values. As a special case, if a <a>dictionary</a>
      contains no keys other than <code>@graph</code> and <code>@context</code>, and the
      <a>dictionary</a> is the root of the JSON-LD document, the
      <a>dictionary</a> is not treated as a <a>node object</a>; this

  <p>JSON-LD is a

      means that JSON-LD serializes

    <li>In JSON-LD <a>lists</a> use native JSON syntax, either contained in a

      defines the <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#data-round-tripping">conversion rules</a>
      between JSON's native data types and RDF's counterparts to allow round-tripping.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Summarized, these differences mean that JSON-LD is capable of serializing any RDF
    <a>graph</a> or <a>dataset</a> and most, but not all, JSON-LD documents can be directly
    interpreted as RDF as described in RDF 1.1 Concepts [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]].</p>

  <p>For authors and developers working with <a>blank nodes</a>
    as <a>properties</a> when deserializing to RDF,
    three potential approaches are suggested:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the author is not yet ready to commit to a stable IRI, the
      property should be mapped to a <a>relative IRI</a>, or an IRI that is documented as unstable.</li>
    <li>If the developer wishes to use <a>blank nodes</a>
      as <a>properties</a> and also wishes to interpret the
      data as a
      <a>generalized RDF Dataset</a>,
      there is an option, <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#dom-jsonldoptions-producegeneralizedrdf"><em>produce generalized RDF</em></a>, in the
      <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#deserialize-json-ld-to-rdf-algorithm">Deserialize JSON-LD to RDF algorithm</a> [[JSON-LD11-API]] to do so. Note that a
      <a>generalized RDF Dataset</a>
      is an extension of RDF; it does not conform to the RDF standard.</li>
    <li>If the author or developer wishes to use <a>blank nodes</a>
      as <a>properties</a> and wishes to interpret the data
      as a standard (non-generalized)
      <a>RDF Dataset</a>,
      it is possible to losslessly interpret JSON-LD as RDF by transforming
      <a>blank nodes</a> used as
      <a>properties</a> to <a>IRIs</a>,
      by minting new "Skolem IRIs" as per
      <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#section-skolemization">Replacing Blank Nodes with IRIs</a>
      of [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]].</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The normative algorithms for interpreting JSON-LD as RDF and serializing
    RDF as JSON-LD are specified in the JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API
    specification [[JSON-LD11-API]].</p>

  <p>Even though JSON-LD serializes
    <a>generalized RDF Datasets</a>, it can
    also be used as a <dfn data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-source">RDF graph source</dfn>.
    In that case, a consumer MUST only use the <a>default graph</a> and ignore all <a>named graphs</a>.
    This allows servers to expose data in languages such as Turtle and JSON-LD
    using content negotiation.</p>

  <p class="note">Publishers supporting both <a>dataset</a> and <a>graph</a> syntaxes have to ensure that
    the primary data is stored in the <a>default graph</a> to enable consumers that do not support
    <a>datasets</a> to process the information.</p>

    <h3>Serializing/Deserializing RDF</h3>

    <p>The process of serializing RDF as JSON-LD and deserializing JSON-LD to RDF
      depends on executing the algorithms defined in
      <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#rdf-serialization-deserialization-algorithms">RDF Serialization-Deserialization Algorithms</a>
      in the JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD11-API]].
      It is beyond the scope of this document to detail these algorithms any further,
      but a summary of the necessary operations is provided to illustrate the process.</p>

    <p>The procedure to deserialize a JSON-LD document to RDF involves the
      following steps:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Expand the JSON-LD document, removing any context; this ensures
        that properties, types, and values are given their full representation
        as <a>IRIs</a> and expanded values. <a>Expansion</a>
        is discussed further in <a class="sectionRef" href="#expanded-document-form"></a>.</li>
      <li>Flatten the document, which turns the document into an array of
        <a>node objects</a>. Flattening is discussed
        further in <a class="sectionRef" href="#flattened-document-form"></a>.</li>
      <li>Turn each <a>node object</a> into a series of <a>RDF triples</a>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For example, consider the following JSON-LD document in compact form:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Sample JSON-LD document">
    <!--
    {
      "@context": {
        "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
        "knows": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows"
      },
      "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
      "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
      "knows": [
        {
          "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
          "name": "Manu Sporny"
        }, {
          "name": "Dave Longley"
        }
      ]
    }
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>Running the JSON-LD <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#expansion-algorithm">Expansion</a> and <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#flattening-algorithm">Flattening</a> algorithms against the
      JSON-LD input document in the example above would result in the
      following output:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Flattened and expanded form for the previous example">
    <!--
    [
      {
        "@id": "_:b0",
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": "Dave Longley"
      }, {
        "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": "Manu Sporny"
      }, {
        "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": "Markus Lanthaler",
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows": [
          { "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu" },
          { "@id": "_:b0" }
        ]
      }
    ]
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>Deserializing this to RDF now is a straightforward process of turning
      each <a>node object</a> into one or more RDF triples. This can be
      expressed in Turtle as follows:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         data-content-type="text/turtle"
         data-result-for="Flattened and expanded form for the previous example"
         data-to-rdf
         title="Turtle representation of expanded/flattened document">
    <!--
    @prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

    _:b0 foaf:name "Dave Longley" .

    <http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu> foaf:name "Manu Sporny" .

    <http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/> foaf:name "Markus Lanthaler" ;
        foaf:knows <http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu>, _:b0 .
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>The process of serializing RDF as JSON-LD can be thought of as the
      inverse of this last step, creating an expanded JSON-LD document closely
      matching the triples from RDF, using a single <a>node object</a>
      for all triples having a common subject, and a single <a>property</a>
      for those triples also having a common predicate. The result may
      then be framed by using the
      <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-FRAMING#framing-algorithm">Framing Algorithm</a>
      described in [[JSON-LD11-FRAMING]] to create the desired object embedding.</p>

      <h4>Conversion of native data types</h4>

      <p>In JSON-LD numbers and boolean values are native data types. While [[Turtle]]
        has a shorthand syntax to express such values, RDF's abstract syntax requires
        that numbers and boolean values are represented as typed literals. Thus,
        to allow full round-tripping, the JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD11-API]]
        defines conversion rules between JSON-LD's native data types and RDF's
        counterparts. <a>Numbers</a> without fractions are
        converted to <code>xsd:integer</code>-typed literals, numbers with fractions
        to <code>xsd:double</code>-typed literals and the two boolean values
        <a>true</a> and <a>false</a> to a <code>xsd:boolean</code>-typed
        literal. All typed literals are in canonical lexical form.</p>

        <dt><code>profile</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A non-empty list of space-separated URIs identifying specific
            constraints or conventions that apply to a JSON-LD document according to [[!RFC6906]].
            A profile does not change the semantics of the resource representation
            when processed without profile knowledge, so that clients both with
            and without knowledge of a profiled resource can safely use the same
            representation. The <code>profile</code> parameter MAY be used by
            clients to express their preferences in the content negotiation process.
            If the profile parameter is given, a server SHOULD return a document that
            honors the profiles in the list which are recognized by the server.
            It is RECOMMENDED that profile URIs are dereferenceable and provide
            useful documentation at that URI. For more information and background
            please refer to [[!RFC6906]].</p>
          <p>This specification defines three values for the <code>profile</code> parameter.
            To request or specify <a href="#expanded-document-form">expanded JSON-LD document form</a>,
            the URI <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#expanded</code> SHOULD be used.
            To request or specify <a href="#compacted-document-form">compacted JSON-LD document form</a>,
            the URI <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#compacted</code> SHOULD be used.
            To request or specify <a href="#flattened-document-form">flattened JSON-LD document form</a>,
            the URI <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#flattened</code> SHOULD be used.
            Please note that, according [[HTTP11]], the value of the <code>profile</code>
            parameter has to be enclosed in quotes (<code>"</code>) because it contains
            special characters and, if multiple profiles are combined, whitespace.</p>
          <p>When processing the "profile" media type parameter, it is important to
            note that its value contains one or more URIs and not IRIs. In some cases
            it might therefore be necessary to convert between IRIs and URIs as specified in
            <a data-cite="RFC3986#section-5.1">section 3 Relationship between IRIs and URIs</a>
            of [[RFC3987]].</p>

    <dt>Encoding considerations:</dt>
    <dd>See <a data-cite="RFC6839#section-3.1">RFC&nbsp;6839, section 3.1</a>.</dd>
    <dt>Security considerations:</dt>
    <dd>See [[!RFC8259]]
      <p>Since JSON-LD is intended to be a pure data exchange format for
        directed graphs, the serialization SHOULD NOT be passed through a
        code execution mechanism such as JavaScript's <code>eval()</code>
        function to be parsed. An (invalid) document may contain code that,
        when executed, could lead to unexpected side effects compromising
        the security of a system.</p>
      <p>When processing JSON-LD documents, links to remote contexts are
        typically followed automatically, resulting in the transfer of files
        without the explicit request of the user for each one. If remote
        contexts are served by third parties, it may allow them to gather
        usage patterns or similar information leading to privacy concerns.
        Specific implementations, such as the API defined in the
        JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [[!JSON-LD11-API]],
        may provide fine-grained mechanisms to control this behavior.</p>
      <p>JSON-LD contexts that are loaded from the Web over non-secure connections,
        such as HTTP, run the risk of being altered by an attacker such that
        they may modify the JSON-LD <a>active context</a> in a way that
        could compromise security. It is advised that any application that
        depends on a remote context for mission critical purposes vet and
        cache the remote context before allowing the system to use it.</p>
      <p>Given that JSON-LD allows the substitution of long IRIs with short terms,
        JSON-LD documents may expand considerably when processed and, in the worst case,
        the resulting data might consume all of the recipient's resources. Applications
        should treat any data with due skepticism.</p>

  <h4>Open Issues</h4>
  <p>The following is a list of issues open at the time of publication.</p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="4">Consider using <code>"@type": "@json"</code> to describe native values in the compact form.</p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="7">Allows a term definition to include an <code>@values</code> block to describe structured values, such as for GeoJSON.</p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="8">When requesting JSON-LD from an HTTP endpoint, it would be useful to provide a reference to a context or frame which should be used by the server to put the results into the proper format.</p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="9">Provide a means for refering to a remote context without without requiring it to be downloaded.</p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="15">Consider a container type, similar to <code>@list</code> for encoding things like <code>schema:ItemList</code> serializations, when the values are schema:ListItem and order is set through <code>schema:position</code>.</p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="17">Consider the opposite of <code>"@container": "@set"</code>; this would be when there is exactly one entry in an <code>@list</code>, instead of compacting to an array, compact to a single item.</p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="18">It would be useful if JSON-LD recognized  both value (<code>rdf:nil</code>) and list (<code>[]</code>).</p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="19">Consider a mechanism such as Microdata's <code>@itemref</code> for including objects within another referencing node.</p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="20">Mechinism to allow freezing terms so that additional contexts don't override them.</p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="23">Should consider <code>html>head>base@href</code> and <code>xml:base</code>, as appropriate.</p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="25">Update terminology in the spec from <a>IRI</a> to <em>URL</em>.</p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="26">For every example, there should be an equivalent of the example in the expanded form, in a table with the triples, in [[Turtle]] (as close to the JSON-LD structure as possible) and, possibly, as graphs. Not all of them would appear on the screen at the same time but, rather, the reader could choose what to see with some tabs.</p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="29"></p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="30">Proposal is to start from scratch, ie, deprecating <code>@graph</code> and replacing the functionality with something cleaner.</p>
  <div class="issue" data-number="33">
<ul>
<li>Give each JSON-LD feature a name. For example: aliasing, reverseProperties, typeCoercion, etc.</li>
<li>Each JSON-LD version will officially support a set of these features. For example, JSON-LD 1.0 supports roughly ~20, JSON-LD 1.1 supports roughly ~30, and so on.</li>
<li>Move some of these less-used features (based on real world data/usage) into a "Advanced JSON-LD Features" specification to keep the base specification simpler and more easily readable.</li>
<li>Extend the @version keyword to take an array, where you can specify experimental extensions. For example: <code>"@version": [1.1, "amazingExtensionFoo", "nicheExtensionBar"]</code> - processors throw if they don't understand every extension listed.</li>
</ul>
</div>
  <p class="issue" data-number="34">Ensure that the output is consistent in shape. Thus if there can ever be multiple values, the structure is always an array.</p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="37"></p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="38"></p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="46"></p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="48"></p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="56">Consider issues surrounding confusion of differing expansion rules for <code>@id</code>, <code>@type</code>, and <a>dictionary members</a>.</p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="57">Require JSON-LD processors to be able to identify and extract JSON-LD from a script tag with type <code>application/ld+json</code> within an HTML document.</p>
  <p class="issue" data-number="59">
    Instead of normatively requiring an initial context, such as RDFa does, instead JSON-LD has the ability to import contexts. This approach means that the existing context rules are followed, and the best practice context can be updated over time as new norms emerge in the community. If the best practice context is not useful to a particular community, then they don't need to import it.

  <h2>Changes since 1.0 Recommendation of 16 January 2014</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A context may contain a <code>@version</code> <a>member</a> which is used to set the <a>processing mode</a>.</li>
    <li>An <a>expanded term definition</a> can now have an
      <code>@context</code> property, which defines a <a>context</a> used for values of
      a <a>property</a> identified with such a <a>term</a>.</li>
    <li><code>@container</code> values within an <a>expanded term definition</a> may now
      include <code>@id</code>, <code>@graph</code> and <code>@type</code>, corresponding to <a>id maps</a> and <a>type maps</a>.</li>
    <li>An <a>expanded term definition</a> can now have an
      <code>@nest</code> property, which identifies a term expanding to
      <code>@nest</code> which is used for containing properties using the same
      <code>@nest</code> mapping. When expanding, the values of a property
      expanding to <code>@nest</code> are treated as if they were contained
      within the enclosing <a>node object</a> directly.</li>
    <li>The JSON syntax has been abstracted into an <a>internal representation</a>
      to allow for other serializations that are functionally equivalent
      to JSON.</li>
    <li>Added <a href="#node-identifier-indexing" class="sectionRef"></a> and <a href="#node-type-indexing" class="sectionRef"></a>.</li>
    <li>Both <a>language maps</a> and <a>index maps</a> may legitimately have an <code>@none</code> key, but
      JSON-LD 1.0 only allowed <a>string</a> keys. This has been updated
      to allow <code>@none</code> keys.</li>
    <li>The value for <code>@container</code> in an <a>expanded term definition</a>
      can also be an <a>array</a> containing any appropriate container
      keyword along with <code>@set</code> (other than <code>@list</code>).
      This allows a way to ensure that such property values will always
      be expressed in <a>array</a> form.</li>
    <li>In JSON-LD 1.1, terms will be chosen as <a>compact IRI</a> prefixes
      when compacting only if
      a <a>simple term definition</a> is used where the value ends with a URI <a data-cite="RFC3986#section-2.2">gen-delim</a> character,
      or if their <a>expanded term definition</a> contains
      a <code>@prefix</code> <a>member</a> with the value <a>true</a>. The 1.0 algorithm has
      been updated to only consider terms that map to a value that ends with a URI
      <a data-cite="RFC3986#section-2.2">gen-delim</a> character.</li>
    <li>Values of properties where the associated <a>term definition</a>
      has <code>@container</code> set to <code>@graph</code> are interpreted as
      <a>implicitly named graphs</a>, where the associated graph name is
      assigned from a new <a>blank node identifier</a>. Other combinations
      include <code>["@container", "@id"]</code>, <code>["@container", "@index"]</code> each also
      may include <code>"@set"</code>, which create maps from the
      graph identifier or index value similar to <a>index maps</a>
      and <a>id maps</a>.</li>
    <li>The empty string (<code>&quot;&quot;</code>) has been added as a possible value for <code>@vocab</code> in
      a context. When this is set, vocabulary-relative IRIs, such as the
      keys of <a>node objects</a>, are expanded or compacted relative
      to the <a>base IRI</a> using string concatenation.</li>
    <li><a>Lists</a> may now have items which are themselves <a>lists</a>.</li>

  <p><strong>For the 1.0 version of the specification</strong></p>

  <p>The authors would like to extend a deep appreciation and the most sincere
    thanks to Mark Birbeck, who contributed foundational concepts
    to JSON-LD via his work on RDFj. JSON-LD uses a number of core concepts
    introduced in RDFj, such as the context as a mechanism to provide an
    environment for interpreting JSON data. Mark had also been very involved in
    the work on RDFa as well. RDFj built upon that work. JSON-LD exists
    because of the work and ideas he started nearly a decade ago in 2004.</p>

  <p>A large amount of thanks goes out to the JSON-LD Community Group
    participants who worked through many of the technical issues on the mailing
    list and the weekly telecons - of special mention are François Daoust,
    Stéphane Corlosquet, Lin Clark, and Zdenko 'Denny' Vrandečić.</p>

  <p>The work of David I. Lehn and Mike Johnson are appreciated for
    reviewing, and performing several early implementations
    of the specification. Thanks also to Ian Davis for this work on RDF/JSON.</p>
