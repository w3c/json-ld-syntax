  <p>JSON is a useful data serialization and messaging format.
    This specification defines JSON-LD, a JSON-based format to serialize
    Linked Data. The syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed
    systems that already use JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from
    JSON to JSON-LD.
    It is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based
    programming environments, to build interoperable Web services, and to
    store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines.</p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>Linked Data [[LINKED-DATA]] is a way to create a network of
   standards-based machine interpretable data across different documents and
   Web sites. It allows an application to start at one piece of Linked Data,
   and follow embedded links to other pieces of Linked Data that are hosted on
   different sites across the Web.</p>
