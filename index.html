  <p>JSON is a useful data serialization and messaging format.

    Linked Data. The syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed
    systems that already use JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from
    JSON to JSON-LD.
    It is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based
    programming environments, to build interoperable Web services, and to
    store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines.</p>

    <h2>Set of Documents</h2>
    <p>This document is one of three JSON-LD 1.1 Recommendations produced by the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/json-ld-wg/">JSON-LD Working Group</a>:</p>

    <ul>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>Linked Data [[LINKED-DATA]] is a way to create a network of
   standards-based machine interpretable data across different documents and
   Web sites. It allows an application to start at one piece of Linked Data,
   and follow embedded links to other pieces of Linked Data that are hosted on
   different sites across the Web.</p>

  <p>JSON-LD is a lightweight syntax to serialize Linked Data in
    JSON [[RFC8259]]. Its design allows existing JSON to be interpreted as
    Linked Data with minimal changes. JSON-LD is primarily intended to be a
    way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments, to build
    interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines. Since
    JSON-LD is 100% compatible with JSON, the large number of JSON parsers and libraries
    available today can be reused. In addition to all the features JSON provides,
    JSON-LD introduces:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>a universal identifier mechanism for <a>JSON objects</a>
      via the use of <a>IRIs</a>,</li>
    <li>a way to disambiguate keys shared among different JSON documents by mapping
      them to <a>IRIs</a> via a <a>context</a>,</li>
    <li>a mechanism in which a value in a <a>JSON object</a> may refer
      to a <a>resource</a> on a different site on the Web,</li>
    <li>the ability to annotate <a>strings</a> with their language,</li>
    <li>a way to associate datatypes with values such as dates and times,</li>
    <li>and a facility to express one or more directed graphs, such as a social
      network, in a single document.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>JSON-LD is designed to be usable directly as JSON, with no knowledge of RDF
   [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]]. It is also designed to be usable as RDF
   in conjunction with other Linked Data technologies like SPARQL [[SPARQL11-OVERVIEW]].
   Developers who
   require any of the facilities listed above or need to serialize an <a>RDF graph</a>
   or <a>Dataset</a> in a JSON-based syntax will find JSON-LD of interest. People
   intending to use JSON-LD with RDF tools will find it can be used as another
   RDF syntax, as with [[Turtle]] and [[TriG]]. Complete details of how JSON-LD relates
   to RDF are in section <a href="#relationship-to-rdf"></a>.
  </p>

  <p>The syntax is designed to not disturb already
   deployed systems running on JSON, but provide a smooth upgrade path from
   JSON to JSON-LD. Since the shape of such data varies wildly, JSON-LD
   features mechanisms to reshape documents into a deterministic structure
   which simplifies their processing.</p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>How to Read this Document</h2>

    <p>This document is a detailed specification for a serialization of Linked
      Data in JSON. The document is primarily intended for the following audiences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Software developers who want to encode Linked Data in a variety of
        programming languages that can use JSON</li>
      <li>Software developers who want to convert existing JSON to JSON-LD</li>
      <li>Software developers who want to understand the design decisions and
        language syntax for JSON-LD</li>
      <li>Software developers who want to implement processors and APIs for
        JSON-LD</li>
      <li>Software developers who want to generate or consume Linked Data,
        an <a>RDF graph</a>, or an <a>RDF Dataset</a> in a JSON syntax</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A companion document, the JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification
      [[JSON-LD11-API]], specifies how to work with JSON-LD at a higher level by
      providing a standard library interface for common JSON-LD operations.</p>

    <p>To understand the basics in this specification you must first be familiar with
      <a data-cite="RFC8259" data-no-xref="">JSON</a>, which is detailed in [[RFC8259]].</p>

    <p>This document almost exclusively uses the term IRI
    (<a data-cite="ld-glossary#internationalized-resource-identifier">Internationalized Resource Indicator</a>)
    when discussing hyperlinks. Many Web developers are more familiar with the
    URL (<a data-cite="ld-glossary#uniform-resource-locator">Uniform Resource Locator</a>)
    terminology. The document also uses, albeit rarely, the URI
    (<a data-cite="ld-glossary#uniform-resource-identifier">Uniform Resource Indicator</a>)
    terminology. While these terms are often used interchangeably among
    technical communities, they do have important distinctions from one
    another and the specification goes to great lengths to try and use the
    proper terminology at all times.

  <h2>Design Goals and Rationale</h2>

  <p>JSON-LD satisfies the following design goals:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt>Simplicity</dt>
   <dd>No extra processors or software libraries are necessary to use JSON-LD
     in its most basic form. The language provides developers with a very easy
     learning curve. Developers not concerned with Linked Data only need to understand JSON,
     and know to include but ignore the <code>@context</code> property,
     to use the basic functionality in JSON-LD.</dd>
   <dt>Compatibility</dt>
   <dd>A JSON-LD document is always a valid JSON document. This ensures that
    all of the standard JSON libraries work seamlessly with JSON-LD documents.</dd>
   <dt>Expressiveness</dt>
   <dd>The syntax serializes labeled directed graphs. This ensures that almost
    every real world data model can be expressed.</dd>
   <dt>Terseness</dt>
   <dd>The JSON-LD syntax is very terse and human readable, requiring as
    little effort as possible from the developer.</dd>
   <dt>Zero Edits, most of the time</dt>
   <dd>JSON-LD ensures a smooth and simple transition from existing
     JSON-based systems. In many cases,
     zero edits to the JSON document and the addition of one line to the HTTP response
     should suffice (see <a class="sectionRef" href="#interpreting-json-as-json-ld"></a>).
     This allows organizations that have
     already deployed large JSON-based infrastructure to use JSON-LD's features
     in a way that is not disruptive to their day-to-day operations and is
     transparent to their current customers. However, there are times where
     mapping JSON to a graph representation is a complex undertaking.
     In these instances, rather than extending JSON-LD to support
     esoteric use cases, we chose not to support the use case. While Zero
     Edits is a design goal, it is not always possible without adding
     great complexity to the language. JSON-LD focuses on simplicity when
     possible.</dd>
    <dt>Usable as RDF</dt>
    <dd>JSON-LD is usable by developers as
      idiomatic JSON, with no need to understand RDF [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]].
      JSON-LD is also usable as RDF, so people intending to use JSON-LD
      with RDF tools will find it can be used like any other RDF syntax.
      Complete details of how JSON-LD relates to RDF are in section
      <a href="#relationship-to-rdf"></a>.</dd>

    <h2>Data Model Overview</h2>

    <p>Generally speaking, the data model described by a <a>JSON-LD document</a> is a labeled, directed <a>graph</a>.
      The graph contains <a>nodes</a>, which are connected by directed-arcs.
      A node is either a <a>resource</a> with <a>properties</a>, or the data values of those properties including
      <a>strings</a>, <a>numbers</a>, <a>typed values</a> (like dates and times) and <a>IRIs</a>.</p>
    <p class="changed">Within a directed graph, nodes are <a>resources</a>, and may
      be <em>unnamed</em>, i.e., not identified by an <a>IRI</a>;
      which are called <a>blank nodes</a>,
      and may be identified using a <a>blank node identifier</a>.
      These identifiers may be required to represent a fully connected graph
      using a tree structure, such as JSON, but otherwise have no
      intrinsic meaning.
      Literal values, such as <a>strings</a> and <a>numbers</a>, are also considered <a>resources</a>,
      and JSON-LD distinguishes between <a>node objects</a> and <a>value objects</a> to distinguish between the different
      kinds of <a>resource</a>.</p>
    <p>This simple data model is incredibly
      flexible and powerful, capable of modeling almost any kind of
      data. For a deeper explanation of the data model, see
      section <a href="#data-model"></a>.</p>

    <p>Developers who are familiar with Linked Data technologies will
      recognize the data model as the RDF Data Model. To dive deeper into how
      JSON-LD and RDF are related, see
      section <a href="#relationship-to-rdf"></a>.</p>

    <p>At the surface level, a <a>JSON-LD document</a> is simply
      <a data-cite="RFC8259" data-no-xref="">JSON</a>, detailed in [[RFC8259]].

    <h2>Syntax Tokens and Keywords</h2>

    <p>JSON-LD specifies a number of syntax tokens and <a>keywords</a>
    that are a core part of the language:</p>

    <dl data-sort>
      <dt><code>@context</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to define the short-hand names that are used throughout a JSON-LD
        document. These short-hand names are called <a>terms</a> and help
        developers to express specific identifiers in a compact manner. The
        <code>@context</code> keyword is described in detail in
        <a class="sectionRef" href="#the-context"></a>.</dd>
      <dt class="changed"><code>@direction</code></dt>
      <dd class="changed">Used to set the <dfn>base direction</dfn> of a <a>JSON-LD value</a>,
        which are not <a>typed values</a> (e.g. <a>strings</a>, or <a>language-tagged strings</a>).
        This keyword is described in
        <a class="sectionRef" href="#string-internationalization"></a>.</dd>
      <dt><code>@id</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to uniquely identify <a>node objects</a> that are being described in the document
        with <a>IRIs</a> or
        <a>blank node identifiers</a>. This keyword
        is described in <a class="sectionRef" href="#node-identifiers"></a>.</dd>
      <dt><code>@value</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to specify the data that is associated with a particular
        <a>property</a> in the graph. This keyword is described in

        <a class="sectionRef" href="#typed-values"></a>.</dd>
      <dt><code>@language</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to specify the language for a particular string value or the default

          Experts may find the overloaded use of the <code>@type</code> keyword for both purposes concerning,
          but should note that Web developer usage of this feature over multiple years
          has not resulted in its misuse due to the far less frequent use of <code>@type</code>

  <h1>Basic Concepts</h1>

  <p>JSON [[RFC8259]] is a lightweight, language-independent data interchange format.
    It is easy to parse and easy to generate. However, it is difficult to integrate JSON
    from different sources as the data may contain keys that conflict with other
    data sources. Furthermore, JSON has no
    built-in support for hyperlinks, which are a fundamental building block on
    the Web. Let's start by looking at an example that we will be using for the
    rest of this section:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Sample JSON document">
  <!--
  {
    "name": "Manu Sporny",
    "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/",
    "image": "http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png"
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>It's obvious to humans that the data is about a person whose
    <code>name</code> is "Manu Sporny"
    and that the <code>homepage</code> property contains the URL of that person's homepage.
    A machine doesn't have such an intuitive understanding and sometimes,
    even for humans, it is difficult to resolve ambiguities in such representations. This problem
    can be solved by using unambiguous identifiers to denote the different concepts instead of
    tokens such as "name", "homepage", etc.</p>

  <p>Linked Data, and the Web in general, uses <a>IRIs</a>
    (<a data-cite="RFC3987#section-2">Internationalized Resource Identifiers</a> as described in [[RFC3987]]) for unambiguous
    identification. The idea is to use <a>IRIs</a>
    to assign unambiguous identifiers to data that may be of use to other developers.
    It is useful for <a>terms</a>,
    like <code>name</code> and <code>homepage</code>, to expand to <a>IRIs</a>
    so that developers don't accidentally step on each other's terms. Furthermore, developers and
    machines are able to use this <a>IRI</a> (by using a web browser, for instance) to go to
    the term and get a definition of what the term means. This process is known as <a>IRI</a>
    dereferencing.</p>

  <p>Leveraging the popular <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org vocabulary</a>,
    the example above could be unambiguously expressed as follows:</p>

  <aside class="example ds-selector-tabs"
         title="Sample JSON-LD document using full IRIs instead of terms">
    <div class="selectors">
      <button class="selected" data-selects="expanded">Expanded (Input)</button>
      <button data-selects="statements">Statements</button>

      <a class="playground" target="_blank"></a>
    </div>
    <pre class="expanded input selected nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample">
    <!--
    {
      "****http://schema.org/name****": "Manu Sporny",
      "****http://schema.org/url****": ****{
        "@id": ****"http://manu.sporny.org/"
        ####↑ The '@id' keyword means 'This value is an identifier that is an IRI'####
      ****}****,
      "****http://schema.org/image****": ****{
        "@id": ****"http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png"
      ****}****
    }
    -->

      <tbody>
        <tr><td>_:b0</td><td>schema:image</td><td>http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png</td></tr>
        <tr><td>_:b0</td><td>schema:name</td><td>Manu Sporny</td></tr>
        <tr><td>_:b0</td><td>schema:url</td><td>http://manu.sporny.org/</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <pre class="turtle"
         data-content-type="text/turtle"
         data-result-for="Sample JSON-LD document using full IRIs instead of terms-expanded"
         data-transform="updateExample"
         data-to-rdf>
    <!--
    @prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .
    @prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

     [

       schema:name "Manu Sporny";
       schema:url <http://manu.sporny.org/>
     ] .
    -->
    </pre>
  </aside>

  <p>In the example above, every property is unambiguously identified by an <a>IRI</a> and all values
    representing <a>IRIs</a> are explicitly marked as such by the
    <code>@id</code> <a>keyword</a>. While this is a valid JSON-LD
    document that is very specific about its data, the document is also overly verbose and difficult
    to work with for human developers. To address this issue, JSON-LD introduces the notion
    of a <a>context</a> as described in the next section.</p>

  <p>This section only covers the most basic features of JSON-LD. More advanced features,
    including <a>typed values</a>, <a href="#indexed-values">indexed values</a>, and <a>named graphs</a>,
    can be found in <a class="sectionRef" href="#advanced-concepts"></a>.</p>


  <section class="informative">
    <h2>The Context</h2>

    <p>When two people communicate with one another, the conversation takes
    place in a shared environment, typically called
    "the context of the conversation". This shared context allows the
    individuals to use shortcut terms, like the first name of a mutual friend,
    to communicate more quickly but without losing accuracy. A context in
    JSON-LD works in the same way. It allows two applications to use shortcut
    terms to communicate with one another more efficiently, but without
    losing accuracy.</p>

    <p>Simply speaking, a <a>context</a> is used to map <a>terms</a> to <a>IRIs</a>.
      <a>Terms</a> are case sensitive and most valid <a>strings</a> that are not reserved JSON-LD <a>keywords</a>
      can be used as a <a>term</a>.
      <span class="changed">Exceptions are the empty string `""` and strings that have the form
        of a keyword (i.e., staring with `"@"`), which must not be used as terms.
        Strings that have the form of
        an absolute IRI (e.g., containing a `":"`) should not be used as terms.</span></p>

    <p>For the sample document in the previous section, a <a>context</a> would
      look something like this:</p>

    <pre class="example context nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
         data-context-for="Sample JSON document"
         title="Context for the sample document in the previous section">
    <!--
    {
      ****"@context": {
        "name": "http://schema.org/name",****
        ####↑ This means that 'name' is shorthand for 'http://schema.org/name'####
        ****"image": {
          "@id": "http://schema.org/image",****
          ####↑ This means that 'image' is shorthand for 'http://schema.org/image'####
          ****"@type": "@id"****
          ####↑ This means that a string value associated with 'image'
            should be interpreted as an identifier that is an IRI####
        ****},
        "homepage": {
          "@id": "http://schema.org/url",****
          ####↑ This means that 'homepage' is shorthand for 'http://schema.org/url'####
          ****"@type": "@id"****
          ####↑ This means that a string value associated with 'homepage'
            should be interpreted as an identifier that is an IRI#### ****
        }
      }****
    }
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>As the <a>context</a> above shows, the value of a <a>term definition</a> can
      either be a simple string, mapping the <a>term</a> to an <a>IRI</a>,
      or a <a>map</a>.</p>

    <p>A <a>context</a> is introduced using an <a>entry</a> with the key <code>@context</code> and may
      appear within a <a>node object</a> or a <a>value object</a>.</p>

    <p>When an <a>entry</a> with a <a>term</a> key has a <a>map</a> value, the <a>map</a> is called
      an <a>expanded term definition</a>. The example above specifies that
      the values of <code>image</code> and <code>homepage</code>, if they are
      strings, are to be interpreted as
      <a>IRIs</a>. <a>Expanded term definitions</a>
      also allow terms to be used for <a href="#data-indexing">index maps</a>
      and to specify whether <a>array</a> values are to be
      interpreted as <a href="#sets">sets</a> or <a href="#lists">lists</a>.
      <a>Expanded term definitions</a> may
      be defined using <a data-lt="absolute IRI">absolute</a> or
      <a>compact IRIs</a> as keys, which is
      mainly used to associate type or language information with an
      <a data-lt="absolute IRI">absolute</a> or <a>compact IRI</a>.</p>

    <p><a>Contexts</a> can either be directly embedded
      into the document (an <a>embedded context</a>) or be referenced using a URL.
      Assuming the context document in the previous
      example can be retrieved at <code>https://json-ld.org/contexts/person.jsonld</code>,
      it can be referenced by adding a single line and allows a JSON-LD document to
      be expressed much more concisely as shown in the example below:</p>

    <p>The referenced context not only specifies how the terms map to
      <a>IRIs</a> in the Schema.org vocabulary but also
      specifies that string values associated with
      the <code>homepage</code> and <code>image</code> property
      can be interpreted as an <a>IRI</a> (<code>"@type": "@id"</code>,
      see <a class="sectionRef" href="#iris"></a> for more details). This information allows developers
      to re-use each other's data without having to agree to how their data will interoperate
      on a site-by-site basis. External JSON-LD context documents may contain extra
      information located outside of the <code>@context</code> key, such as
      documentation about the <a>terms</a> declared in the
      document. Information contained outside of the <code>@context</code> value
      is ignored when the document is used as an external <dfn data-lt="context document">JSON-LD context document</dfn>.</p>

    <p>JSON documents can be interpreted as JSON-LD without having to be modified by
      referencing a <a>context</a> via an <a data-cite="RFC8288#section-3">HTTP Link Header</a>
      as described in <a class="sectionRef" href="#interpreting-json-as-json-ld"></a>. It is also
      possible to apply a custom context using the JSON-LD 1.1 API [[JSON-LD11-API]].</p>

    <p>In <a>JSON-LD documents</a>,
      <a>contexts</a> may also be specified inline.
      This has the advantage that documents can be processed even in the
      absence of a connection to the Web. Ultimately, this is a modeling decision
      and different use cases may require different handling.

    <p>This section only covers the most basic features of the JSON-LD Context.
      The Context can also be used to help interpret other more
      complex JSON data structures, such as <a href="#indexed-values">indexed values</a>,
      <a href="#sets-and-lists">ordered values</a>, and
      <a href="#nested-properties">nested properties</a>.

  <h2>IRIs</h2>

  <p><a>IRIs</a> (<a data-cite="RFC3987#section-2">Internationalized Resource Identifiers</a>
    [[RFC3987]]) are fundamental to Linked Data as that is how most
    <a>nodes</a> and <a>properties</a>
    are identified. In JSON-LD, IRIs may be represented as an
    <a>absolute IRI</a> or a <a>relative IRI</a>. An
    <a data-cite="RFC3987#section-1.3">absolute IRI</a> is defined in [[RFC3987]] as containing a
    <em>scheme</em> along with <em>path</em> and optional <em>query</em> and
    <em>fragment</em> segments. A <a>relative IRI</a> is an IRI
    that is relative to some other <a>absolute IRI</a>.
    In JSON-LD, with exceptions that are as described below, all <a>relative IRIs</a>
    are resolved relative to the <a>base IRI</a>.</p>

  <p class="note">As noted in <a href="#how-to-read-this-document" class="sectionRef"></a>,
    IRIs can often be confused with URLs (<a data-cite="ld-glossary#uniform-resource-locator">Uniform Resource Locators</a>),
    the primary distinction is that a URL <em>locates</em> a resource on the web,
    an IRI <em>identifies</em> a resource. While it is a good practice for resource identifiers
    to be dereferenceable, sometimes this is not practical. In particular, note the
    [[URN]] scheme for Uniform Resource Names, such as <a data-cite="rfc4122" data-no-xref="">UUID</a>.
    An example UUID is <code>urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6</code>.</p>

  <p class="note"><a>Properties</a>, values of <code>@type</code>,
    and values of <a>properties</a> with a <a>term definition</a>
    that defines them as being relative to the <a>vocabulary mapping</a>,
    may have the form of a <a>relative IRI</a>, but are resolved using the
    <a>vocabulary mapping</a>, and not the <a>base IRI</a>.</p>

  <p>A <a>string</a> is interpreted as an <a>IRI</a> when it is the
    value of a <a>map entry</a> with the key <code>@id</code>:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Values of @id are interpreted as IRI">
  <!--
  {
    ####...####
    "homepage": { "****@id****": "http://example.com/" }
    ####...####
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Values that are interpreted as <a>IRIs</a>, can also be
    expressed as <a>relative IRIs</a>. For example,
    assuming that the following document is located at
    <code>http://example.com/about/</code>, the <a>relative IRI</a>
    <code>../</code> would expand to <code>http://example.com/</code> (for more
    information on where  <a>relative IRIs</a> can be
    used, please refer to section <a href="#json-ld-grammar"></a>).</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="IRIs can be relative">
  <!--
  {
    ####...####
    "homepage": { "****@id****": "../" }
    ####...####
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p><a>Absolute IRIs</a> can be expressed directly
    in the key position like so:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="IRI as a key">
  <!--
  {
    ####...####
    "****http://schema.org/name****": "Manu Sporny"####,
    ...####
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>In the example above, the key <code>http://schema.org/name</code>
    is interpreted as an <a>absolute IRI</a>.</p>

  <p>Term-to-IRI expansion occurs if the key matches a <a>term</a> defined
    within the <a>active context</a>:</p>

  <aside class="example ds-selector-tabs"
         title="Term expansion from context definition">
    <div class="selectors">

  <p>In the example above, since the value <code>http://manu.sporny.org/</code>
    is expressed as a JSON <a>string</a>, the type <a>coercion</a>
    rules will transform the value into an IRI when processing the data.
    See <a class="sectionRef" href="#type-coercion"></a> for more
    details about this feature.</p>

  <p>In summary, <a>IRIs</a> can be expressed in a variety of
    different ways in JSON-LD:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><a>Map entries</a> that have a key mapping to a <a>term</a> in
      the <a>active context</a> expand to an <a>IRI</a>
      (only applies outside of the <a>context definition</a>).</li>
    <li>An <a>IRI</a> is generated for the <a>string</a> value specified using
      <code>@id</code> or <code>@type</code>.</li>
    <li>An <a>IRI</a> is generated for the <a>string</a> value of any key for which there
      are <a>coercion</a> rules that contain an <code>@type</code> key that is
      set to a value of <code>@id</code> or <code>@vocab</code>.</li>

  <h2>Node Identifiers</h2>

  <p>To be able to externally reference <a>nodes</a>
    in an <a>RDF graph</a>, it is important that
    <a>nodes</a> have an identifier. <a>IRIs</a>
    are a fundamental concept of Linked Data, for
    <a>nodes</a> to be truly linked, dereferencing the
    identifier should result in a representation of that <a>node</a>.
    This may allow an application to retrieve further information about a
    <a>node</a>.</p>

  <h2>Uses of JSON Objects</h2>
  <p>As a syntax, JSON has only a limited number of syntactic elements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a>Numbers</a>, which describe literal numeric values,</li>
    <li><a>Strings</a>, which may describe literal string values, or be used as the keys in a <a>JSON object</a>.</li>
    <li><a>Boolean</a> <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, which describe literal boolean values,</li>
    <li><code>null</code>, which describes the absence of a value,</li>
    <li><a>Arrays</a>, which describe an ordered set of values of any type, and</li>
    <li><a>JSON objects</a>, which provide a set of <a>map entries</a>, relating keys with values.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The JSON-LD data model allows for a richer set of resources, based on the RDF data model.
    The data model is described more fully in <a class="sectionRef" href="#data-model"></a>.
    JSON-LD uses JSON objects to describe various resources, along with the relationships
    between these resources:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt><a>Node objects</a></dt><dd>
      Node objects are used to define nodes in the <a>linked data graph</a>
      which may have both incoming and outgoing edges.
      Node objects are principle structure for defining <a>resources</a> having <a>properties</a>.
      See <a class="sectionRef" href="#node-objects"></a> for the normative definition.
    </dd>
    <dt><a>Value objects</a></dt><dd>
      Value objects are used for describing literal nodes in a <a>linked data graph</a>
      which may have only incoming edges.
      In JSON, some literal nodes may be described without the use of a <a>JSON object</a>
      (e.g., <a>numbers</a>, <a>strings</a>, and <a>boolean</a> values),
      but in the <a data-lt="expansion">expanded form</a>,
      all literal nodes are described using <a>value objects</a>.
      See <a class="sectionRef" href="#describing-values"></a> for more information,
      and <a class="sectionRef" href="#value-objects"></a> for the normative definition.
    </dd>
    <dt><a>List Objects</a> and <a>Set objects</a></dt><dd>
      <a>List Objects</a> are a special kind of JSON-LD <a>maps</a>,
      distinct from <a>node objects</a> and <a>value objects</a>,
      used to express ordered values by wrapping an <a>array</a> in a <a>map</a> under the key `@list`.
      <a>Set Objects</a> exist for uniformity, and are equivalent to the array value of the `@set` key.
      See <a href="#lists" class="sectionRef"></a> and <a href="#sets" class="sectionRef"></a>
      for more detail.
    </dd>
    <dt>Map Objects</dt><dd>
      JSON-LD uses various forms of <a>maps</a> as ways to more easily access values of a <a>property</a>.
      <dl>
        <dt><a>Language Maps</a></dt><dd>
          Allows multiple values differing in their associated language to be

        <dt><a>Index Maps</a></dt><dd>

  <h2>Specifying the Type</h2>

  <p>In Linked Data, it is common to specify the type of a graph node;
    in many cases, this can be inferred based on the properties used within a
    given <a>node object</a>, or the property for which a node is a value. For
    example, in the <em>schema.org</em> vocabulary, the <em>givenName</em>
    property is associated with a <em>Person</em>. Therefore, one may reason that
    if a <a>node object</a> contains the property <em>givenName</em>, that the
    type is a <em>Person</em>; making this explicit with <code>@type</code> helps
    to clarify the association.</p>

  <p>The type of a particular <a>node</a> can be specified using the <code>@type</code>
    <a>keyword</a>. In Linked Data, types are uniquely
    identified with an <a>IRI</a>.</p>

  <p class="changed">In addition to setting the type of nodes,

<h1>Advanced Concepts</h1>

<p>JSON-LD has a number of features that provide functionality above and beyond
  the core functionality described above. JSON can be used to express data
  using such structures, and the features described in this
  section can be used to interpret a variety of different JSON structures as
  Linked Data. A JSON-LD processor will make use of provided and embedded
  contexts to interpret property values in a number of different idiomatic
  ways.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Describing values</dt>
  <dd><p>One pattern in JSON is for the value of a property to be a string.
    Often times, this string actually represents some other typed value, for
    example an IRI, a date, or a string in some specific language. See <a
    href="#describing-values" class="sectionRef"></a> for details on how to
    describe such value typing.</p></dd>
  <dt>Value ordering</dt>
  <dd><p>In JSON, a property with an array value implies an implicit order;
    arrays in JSON-LD do not convey any ordering of the contained elements by
    default, unless defined using embedded structures or through a context
    definition. See <a href="#sets-and-lists" class="sectionRef"></a> for a
    further discussion.</p></dd>
  <dt>Property nesting</dt>
  <dd><p>Another JSON idiom often found in APIs is to use an
      intermediate object to group together related properties of an object; in JSON-LD
      these are referred to as <a>nested properties</a> and are described in <a
      href="#nested-properties" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p></dd>
  <dt>Referencing objects</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Linked Data is all about describing the relationships between different resources.
      Sometimes these relationships are between resources defined in different
      documents described on the web, sometimes the resources are described
      within the same document.</p>

  be achieved using JSON-LD.</p>

  <p>In general, contexts may be used any time a
    <a>map</a> is defined.
    The only time that one cannot express a context is as a direct child of another context definition (other than as part of an <a>expanded term definition</a>).
    For example, a <a>JSON-LD document</a> may
    have the form of an <a>array</a> composed of one or more <a>node objects</a>,
    which use a context definition in each top-level <a>node object</a>:</p>

  <p>In the example above, the <code>name</code> <a>term</a> is overridden
    in the more deeply nested <code>details</code> structure,
    which uses its own <a>embedded context</a>.
    Note that this is
    rarely a good authoring practice and is typically used when working with
    legacy applications that depend on a specific structure of the
    <a>map</a>. If a <a>term</a> is redefined within a
    context, all previous rules associated with the previous definition are
    removed. If a <a>term</a> is redefined to <code>null</code>,
    the <a>term</a> is effectively removed from the list of
    <a>terms</a> defined in the <a>active context</a>.</p>

  <p>Multiple contexts may be combined using an <a>array</a>, which is processed
    in order. The set of contexts defined within a specific <a>map</a> are
    referred to as <a>local contexts</a>. The
    <a>active context</a> refers to the accumulation of
    <a>local contexts</a> that are in scope at a
    specific point within the document. Setting a <a>local context</a>
    to <code>null</code> effectively resets the <a>active context</a>
    to an empty context, without <a>term definitions</a>, <a>default language</a>,
    or other things defined within previous contexts.
    The following example specifies an external context
    and then layers an <a>embedded context</a> on top of the external context:</p>

  <p class="changed">In JSON-LD 1.1, there are other mechanisms for introducing contexts, including
    scoped contexts and imported contexts, and there are new ways of protecting term definitions,
    so there are cases where the last defined inline context is not necessarily one
    which defines the scope of terms.
    See <a href="#scoped-contexts" class="sectionRef"></a>,
    <a href="#context-propagation" class="sectionRef"></a>,
    <a href="#imported-contexts" class="sectionRef"></a>, and

  <p class="note">When possible, the <a>context</a> definition should be put
    at the top of a JSON-LD document. This makes the document easier to read and
    might make streaming parsers more efficient. Documents that do not have the
    <a>context</a> at the top are still conformant JSON-LD.</p>

  <p class="note">To avoid forward-compatibility issues, <a>terms</a>
    starting with an&nbsp;<code>@</code> character are to be avoided as they
    might be used as <a>keyword</a> in future versions
    of JSON-LD. Terms starting with an&nbsp;<code>@</code> character that are not
    <a data-lt="keyword">JSON-LD 1.1 keywords</a> are treated as any other term, i.e.,
    they are ignored unless mapped to an <a>IRI</a>. Furthermore, the use of
    empty <a>terms</a> (<code>""</code>) is not allowed as
    not all programming languages are able to handle empty JSON keys.</p>

<section class="changed informative"><h2>JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Mode</h2>

  <p>New features defined in JSON-LD 1.1 are available
    when the <a>processing mode</a> is set to <code>json-ld-1.1</code>.
    This may be set using the <code>@version</code> <a>entry</a> in a <code>context</code>
    set to the value <code>1.1</code> as a <a>number</a>, or through an API option.</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"

  {
    "@context": {
      ****"@version": 1.1****####,
      ...####
    }####,
    ...####
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>The first <code>context</code> encountered when processing a
    document which contains <code>@version</code> determines the <code>processing mode</code>,
    unless it is defined explicitly through an API option.
    This means that if <code>"@version": 1.1</code> is encountered after processing a context
    without <code>@version</code>,
    the former will be interpreted as having had <code>"@version": 1.1</code> defined within it.</p>

  <p class="note">Setting the <a>processing mode</a> explicitly
    for JSON-LD 1.1 is necessary so that a [[[JSON-LD10]]] processor
    does not attempt to process a JSON-LD 1.1 document and silently
    produce different results.</p>
</section>

<section class="informative"><h2>Default Vocabulary</h2>

  <p>At times, all properties and types may come from the same vocabulary. JSON-LD's
    <code>@vocab</code> keyword allows an author to set a common prefix which
    is used as the <a>vocabulary mapping</a> and is used
    for all properties and types that do not match a <a>term</a> and are neither
    a <a>compact IRI</a> nor an <a>absolute IRI</a> (i.e., they do

<section class="informative"><h2>Base IRI</h2>

  <p>JSON-LD allows <a>IRIs</a>
    to be specified in a relative form which is
    resolved against the document base according
    <a data-cite="RFC3986#section-5.1">section 5.1 Establishing a Base URI</a>
    of [[RFC3986]]. The <a>base IRI</a> may be explicitly set with a <a>context</a>
    using the <code>@base</code> keyword.</p>

  <p>For example, if a JSON-LD document was retrieved from <code>http://example.com/document.jsonld</code>,
    relative IRIs would resolve against that IRI:</p>

<section class="informative"><h2>Compact IRIs</h2>

  <p>A <a>compact IRI</a> is a way of expressing an <a>IRI</a>
    using a <em>prefix</em> and <em>suffix</em> separated by a colon (<code>:</code>).
    The <a>prefix</a> is a <a>term</a> taken from the
    <a>active context</a> and is a short string identifying a
    particular <a>IRI</a> in a JSON-LD document. For example, the
    prefix <code>foaf</code> may be used as a shorthand for the
    Friend-of-a-Friend vocabulary, which is identified using the <a>IRI</a>
    <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/</code>. A developer may append
    any of the FOAF vocabulary terms to the end of the prefix to specify a short-hand
    version of the <a>absolute IRI</a> for the vocabulary term. For example,
    <code>foaf:name</code> would be expanded to the IRI
    <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name</code>.</p>

  <p>In the example above, <code>foaf:name</code> expands to the <a>IRI</a>
    <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name</code> and <code>foaf:Person</code> expands
    to <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person</code>.</p>

  <p><a>Prefixes</a> are expanded when the form of the value
    is a <a>compact IRI</a> represented as a <code>prefix:suffix</code>
    combination, the <em>prefix</em> matches a <a>term</a> defined within the
    <a>active context</a>, and the <em>suffix</em> does not begin with two
    slashes&nbsp;(<code>//</code>). The <a>compact IRI</a> is expanded by
    concatenating the <a>IRI</a> mapped to the <em>prefix</em> to the (possibly empty)
    <em>suffix</em>. If the <em>prefix</em> is not defined in the <a>active context</a>,
    or the suffix begins with two slashes (such as in <code>http://example.com</code>),
    the value is interpreted as <a>absolute IRI</a> instead. If the prefix is an
    underscore (<code>_</code>), the value is interpreted as <a>blank node identifier</a>
    instead.</p>

  <p>It's also possible to use compact IRIs within the context as shown in the
    following example:</p>

<section class="informative"><h2>IRI Expansion within a Context</h2>
  <p>In general, normal IRI expansion rules apply
    anywhere an IRI is expected (see <a class="sectionRef" href="#iris"></a>). Within
    a <a>context</a> definition, this can mean that terms defined
    within the context may also be used within that context as long as
    there are no circular dependencies. For example, it is common to use
    the <code>xsd</code> namespace when defining <a>typed values</a>:</p>

<pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="IRI expansion within a context">
<!--
{
  "@context": {
    ****"xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#"****,
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
    "age": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age",
      "@type": ****"xsd:integer"****
    },
    "homepage": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  }####,
  ...####
}
-->
</pre>

<p>In this example, the <code>xsd</code> <a>term</a> is defined
  and used as a <a>prefix</a> for the <code>@type</code> coercion
  of the <code>age</code> property.</p>

<p><a>Terms</a> may also be used when defining the IRI of another
<a>term</a>:</p>

<pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Using a term to define the IRI of another term within a context">
<!--
{
  "@context": {
    ****"foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"****,
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "name": ****"foaf:name"****,
    "age": {
      "@id": ****"foaf:age"****,
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    },
    "homepage": {
      "@id": ****"foaf:homepage"****,
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  }####,
  ...####
}
-->
</pre>

<p><a>Compact IRIs</a>
  and <a>IRIs</a> may be used on the left-hand side of a
  <a>term</a> definition.</p>

<pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Using a compact IRI as a term">
<!--
{
  "@context": {
    ****"foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"****,
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "name": "foaf:name",
    "****foaf:age****": {
      "@id": "****http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age****",
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    },
    "****foaf:homepage****": ****{
      "@type": "@id"
    }****
  }####,
  ...####
}
-->
</pre>

<p>
In this example, the <a>compact IRI</a> form is used in two different ways.
  In the first approach, <code>foaf:age</code> declares both the
  <a>IRI</a> for the <a>term</a> (using short-form) as well as the
  <code>@type</code> associated with the <a>term</a>. In the second
  approach, only the <code>@type</code> associated with the <a>term</a> is
  specified. The full <a>IRI</a> for
  <code>foaf:homepage</code> is determined by looking up the <code>foaf</code>
  <a>prefix</a> in the
  <a>context</a>.</p>

<p class="warning changed">If a <a>compact IRI</a> is used as a <a>term</a>, it must expand to the
  value that <a>compact IRI</a> would have on its own when expanded.
  This represents a change to the original 1.0 algorithm to prevent terms from
  expanding to a different <a>absolute IRI</a>, which could lead to undesired results.</p>

<pre class="illegal-example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Illegal Aliasing of a compact IRI to a different absolute IRI">
<!--
{
  "@context": {
    "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/",
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "name": "foaf:name",
    "foaf:age": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age",
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    },
    "foaf:homepage": {
     ****"@id": "http://schema.org/url"****,
     "@type": "@id"
    }
  }####,
  ...####
}
-->
</pre>

<p><a>Absolute IRIs</a> may also be used in the key position in a <a>context</a>:</p>

<pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Associating context definitions with absolute IRIs">
<!--
{
  "@context": {
    "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/",

    "****http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage****": {
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  }####,
  ...####
}
-->
</pre>

<p>In order for the <a>absolute IRI</a> to match above, the <a>absolute IRI</a>
  needs to be used in the <a>JSON-LD document</a>. Also note that <code>foaf:homepage</code>
  will not use the <code>{ "@type": "@id" }</code> declaration because
  <code>foaf:homepage</code> is not the same as <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage</code>.
  That is, <a>terms</a> are looked up in a <a>context</a> using
  direct string comparison before the <a>prefix</a> lookup mechanism is applied.</p>

<p class="warning changed">Neither a <a>compact IRI</a> nor an <a>absolute IRI</a>
  may expand to some other unrelated <a>IRI</a>.
  This represents a change to the original 1.0 algorithm which allowed this behavior but discouraged it.</p>

<p>The only other exception for using terms in the <a>context</a> is that
  circular definitions are not allowed. That is,
  a definition of <em>term1</em> cannot depend on the
  definition of <em>term2</em> if <em>term2</em> also depends on
  <em>term1</em>. For example, the following <a>context</a> definition
  is illegal:</p>
<pre class="illegal-example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
     data-ignore
     title="Illegal circular definition of terms within a context">

<section class="informative changed"><h2>Scoped Contexts</h2>

  <p>Scoping on <code>@type</code> is useful when common properties are used to
    relate things of different types, where the vocabularies in use within
    different entities calls for different context scoping. For example,
    <code>hasPart</code>/<code>partOf</code> may be common terms used in a document, but mean
    different things depending on the context.
    A <a>type-scoped context</a> is only in effect for the <a>node object</a> on which
    the type is used; the previous in-scope <a>contexts</a> are placed back into
    effect when traversing into another <a>node object</a>.
    As described further in <a href="#context-propagation" class="sectionRef"></a>,
    this may be controlled using the `@propagate` keyword.</p>

  <p class="note">Any <a data-lt="property-scoped context">property-scoped</a> or local <a>contexts</a> that were introduced in the <a>node object</a>
    would still be in effect when traversing into another <a>node object</a>.</p>

  <p>When expanding, each value of <code>@type</code> is considered
    (ordering them lexicographically) where that value is also a <a>term</a> in
    the <a>active context</a> having its own <a>type-scoped context</a>.
    If so, that the <a>scoped context</a> is applied to the <a>active context</a>.</p>

  <p class="note">The values of <code>@type</code> are unordered, so if multiple
    types are listed, the order that <a>type-scoped contexts</a> are applied is based on
    lexicographical ordering.</p>

  <p>For example, consider the following semantically equivalent examples.
    The first example, shows how properties and types can define their own
    scoped contexts, which are included when expanding.</p>

  <p class="note">If a <a>term</a> defines a <a>scoped context</a>,
    and then that term is later redefined,
    the association of the context defined in the earlier

    within the scope of that redefinition. This is consistent with
    <a>term definitions</a> of a term overriding previous term definitions from
    earlier less deeply nested definitions, as discussed in
    <a href="#advanced-context-usage" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>

  <p>Once introduced, <a>contexts</a> remain in effect until a subsequent

    This behavior can be changed using the `@propagate` keyword.</p>

</section>

<section class="informative changed"><h2>Imported Contexts</h2>
  <p>JSON-LD 1.0 included mechanisms for modifying the <a>context</a> that
    is in effect. This included the capability to load and process a remote
    <a>context</a> and then apply further changes to it via new <a>contexts</a>.
  </p>

  <p>However, with the introduction of JSON-LD 1.1, it is also desirable to
    be able to load a remote <a>context</a>, in particular an existing JSON-LD
    1.0 <a>context</a>, and apply JSON-LD 1.1 features to it prior to
    processing.</p>

  <p>By using the `@import` keyword in a <a>context</a>, another remote
    <a>context</a>, referred to as an imported <a>context</a>, can be loaded and
    modified prior to processing. The modifications are expressed in the
    <a>context</a> that includes the `@import` keyword, referred to as the
    wrapping <a>context</a>. Once an imported <a>context</a> is loaded, the
    contents of the wrapping <a>context</a> are merged into it prior to
    processing. The merge operation will cause each key-value pair in the
    wrapping <a>context</a> to be added to the loaded imported <a>context</a>,
    with the wrapping <a>context</a> key-value pairs taking precedence.</p>

  <p>By enabling existing <a>contexts</a> to be reused and edited inline prior
    to processing, context-wide keywords can be applied to adjust all term
    definitions in the imported <a>context</a>. Similarly, term definitions can
    be replaced prior to processing, enabling adjustments that, for instance, ensure term
    definitions match previously protected terms or that they include
    additional type coercion information.</p>

  <p>The following examples illustrate how `@import` can be used to express
    a <a>type-scoped context</a> that loads an imported <a>context</a> and
    sets `@propagate` to `true`, as a technique for making other similar modifications.</p>

  <p>Suppose there was a <a>context</a> that could be referenced remotely
    via the URL <code>https://json-ld.org/contexts/remote-context.jsonld</code>:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="A remote context to be imported in a type-scoped context">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      "Type1": "http://example.com/vocab/Type1",
      "Type2": "http://example.com/vocab/Type2",
      "term1": "http://example.com/vocab#term1",
      "term2": "http://example.com/vocab#term2"####,
      ...####
    }
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>A wrapping <a>context</a> could be used to source it and modify it:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Sourcing a context in a type-scoped context and setting it to propagate">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      "@version": 1.1,
      "MyType": {
        "@id": "http://example.com/vocab#MyType",
        "@context": {
          "@version": 1.1,
          "@import": "https://json-ld.org/contexts/remote-context.jsonld",
          "@propagate": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>The effect would be the same as if the entire imported <a>context</a>
    had been copied into the <a>type-scoped context</a>:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Result of sourcing a context in a type-scoped context and setting it to propagate">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      "@version": 1.1,
      "MyType": {
        "@id": "http://example.com/vocab#MyType",
        "@context": {
          "@version": 1.1,
          "Type1": "http://example.com/vocab/Type1",
          "Type2": "http://example.com/vocab/Type2",
          "term1": "http://example.com/vocab#term1",
          "term2": "http://example.com/vocab#term2",####
          ...####
          "@propagate": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Similarly, the wrapping <a>context</a> may replace term definitions or
    set other context-wide keywords that may affect how the imported
    <a>context</a> term definitions will be processed:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Sourcing a context to modify @vocab and a term definition">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      "@version": 1.1,
      "@import": "https://json-ld.org/contexts/remote-context.jsonld",
      "@vocab": "http://example.org/vocab#",
      #### ↑ This will replace any previous @vocab definition prior to processing it####
      "term1": {
        "@id": "http://example.org/vocab#term1",
        "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer"
      }
      #### ↑ This will replace the old term1 definition prior to processing it####
    }
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Again, the effect would be the same as if the entire imported <a>context</a>
    had been copied into the <a>context</a>:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Result of sourcing a context to modify @vocab and a term definition">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      "@version": 1.1,
      "Type1": "http://example.com/vocab/Type1",
      "Type2": "http://example.com/vocab/Type2",
      "term1": {
        "@id": "http://example.org/vocab#term1",
        "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer"
      },
      #### ↑ Note term1 has been replaced prior to processing####
      "term2": "http://example.com/vocab#term2",####
      ...,####
      "@vocab": "http://example.org/vocab#"
    }
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>The result of loading imported <a>contexts</a> must be
    <a>context definition</a>, not an <a>IRI</a> or an <a>array</a>.
    Additionally, the imported context cannot include an `@import` <a>entry</a>.</p>
</section>

<section class="informative changed"><h2>Protected Term Definitions</h2>
  <p>JSON-LD is used in many specifications as the specified data format.
    However, there is also a desire to allow some JSON-LD contents to be processed as plain JSON,
    without using any of the JSON-LD algorithms.
    Because JSON-LD is very flexible,
    some terms from the original format may be locally overridden
    through the use of <a>embedded contexts</a>,
    and take a different meaning for JSON-LD based implementations.
    On the other hand, "plain JSON" implementations may not be able to interpret these <a>embedded contexts</a>,
    and hence will still interpret those terms with their original meaning.
    To prevent this divergence of interpretation,
    JSON-LD 1.1 allows term definitions to be <em>protected</em>.
    </p>
  <p>A <dfn>protected term definition</dfn> is a term definition with an <a>entry</a> <code>@protected</code> set to <code>true</code>.
    It generally prevents further contexts from overriding this term definition,
    either through a new definition of the same term,
    or through clearing the context with <code>"@context": null</code>.
    Such attempts will raise an error and abort the processing
    (except in some specific situations described
    <a href="#overriding-protected-terms">below</a>).

  <p>When all or most term definitions of a context need to be protected,
    it is possible to add an <a>entry</a> <code>@protected</code> set to <code>true</code>
    to the context itself.
    It has the same effect as protecting each of its term definitions individually.
    Exceptions can be made by adding an <a>entry</a> <code>@protected</code> set to <code>false</code>

  <p id="overriding-protected-terms">
    While protected terms can in general not be overridden,
    there are two exceptions to this rule.
    The first exception is that a context is allowed to redefine a protected term
    if the new definition is identical to the protected term definition
    (modulo the <code>@protected</code> flag).
    The rationale is that the new definition does not violate the protection,
    as it does not change the semantics of the protected term.
    This is useful for widespread term definitions,
    such as aliasing <code>@type</code> to <code>type</code>,
    which may occur (including in a protected form) in several contexts.

  <p>The second exception is that a <a>property-scoped context</a>
    is not affected by protection, and can therefore override protected terms,
    either with a new term definition,
    or by clearing the context with <code>"@context": null</code>.
  </p>
  <p>The rationale is that "plain JSON" implementations,
    relying on a given specification,
    will only traverse properties defined by that specification.
    <a>Scoped contexts</a> belonging to the specified properties are part of the specification,
    so the "plain JSON" implementations are expected to be aware of the change of semantics they induce.
    <a>Scoped contexts</a> belonging to other properties apply to parts of the document that "plain JSON" implementations will ignore.
    In both cases, there is therefore no risk of diverging interpretations between JSON-LD-aware implementations and "plain JSON" implementations,
    so overriding is permitted.

  <p class="note">By preventing terms from being overridden,
    protection also prevents any adaptation of a term
    (e.g., defining a more precise datatype, restricting the term's use to lists, etc.).
    This kind of adaptation is frequent with some general purpose contexts,
    for which protection would therefore hinder their usability.
    As a consequence, context publishers should use this feature with care.

<section class="informative"><h2>Typed Values</h2>

<p>A value with an associated type, also known as a
  <a>typed value</a>, is indicated by associating a value with
  an <a>IRI</a> which indicates the value's type. Typed values may be
  expressed in JSON-LD in three ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>By utilizing the <code>@type</code> <a>keyword</a> when defining
    a <a>term</a> within an <code>@context</code> section.</li>
  <li>By utilizing a <a>value object</a>.</li>
  <li>By using a native JSON type such as <a>number</a>, <code>true</code>, or <code>false</code>.</li>
</ol>

  type with a particular <a>term</a> in the <code>@context</code>:</p>

<p class="note">The <code>@type</code> <a>keyword</a> is also used to associate a type

<p class="note">When expanding, an `@type` defined within a <a>term definition</a>

<p>A <dfn>node type</dfn> specifies the type of thing

<section class="informative changed"><h2>JSON Literals</h2>
  <p>At times, it is useful to include JSON within JSON-LD that is not interpreted as JSON-LD.
    Generally, a JSON-LD processor will ignore properties which don't map to <a>IRIs</a>,
    but this causes them to be excluded when performing various algorithmic transformations.
    But, when the data that is being described is, itself, JSON, it's important that
    it survive algorithmic transformations.</p>

  <p class="warning">JSON-LD is intended to allow native JSON to be
    interpreted through the use of a <a>context</a>.
    The use of <a>JSON literals</a> creates blobs of data which are not available for interpretation.
    It is for use only in the rare cases that JSON cannot be represented as JSON-LD.</p>

  <p>When a term is defined with <code>@type</code> set to <code>@json</code>,
    a JSON-LD processor will treat the value as a <a>JSON literal</a>,
    rather than interpreting it further as JSON-LD.
    In the <a>expanded document form</a>, such JSON will become the value of <code>@value</code> within a <a>value object</a>
    having <code>"@type": "@json"</code>.</p>

  <p>When transformed into RDF, the JSON literal will have a lexical form based on
    a specific serialization of the JSON,
    as described in <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#compaction-algorithm">Compaction algorithm</a> of [[JSON-LD11-API]]
    and <a href="#the-rdf-json-datatype" class="sectionRef">the JSON datatype</a>.</p>

  <p>The following example shows an example of a <a>JSON Literal</a> contained as the
    value of a property. Note that the RDF results use a canonicalized form of the JSON
    to ensure interoperability between different processors.
    JSON canonicalization is described in <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#data-round-tripping">Data Round Tripping</a> in [[JSON-LD11-API]].</p>

<p class="note">Generally, when a JSON-LD processor encounters `null`,
  the associated <a>entry</a> or value is removed.
  However, `null` is a valid JSON token; when used as the value
  of a <a>JSON literal</a>, a `null` value will be preserved.</p>
</section>

<section class="informative"><h2>Type Coercion</h2>

<p>JSON-LD supports the coercion of <a>string</a> values to particular data types.
Type <dfn>coercion</dfn> allows someone deploying JSON-LD to use <a>string</a> property values
and have those values be interpreted as <a>typed values</a>
by associating an <a>IRI</a> with the value in the expanded <a>value object</a> representation.
Using type coercion, <a>string</a> value representation can be used without requiring
the data type to be specified explicitly with each piece of data.</p>

<p>Type coercion is specified within an <a>expanded term definition</a>
  using the <code>@type</code> key. The value of this key expands to an <a>IRI</a>.
  Alternatively, the <a>keyword</a> <code>@id</code> or <code>@vocab</code> may be used
  as value to indicate that within the body of a JSON-LD document, a <a>string</a> value of a
  <a>term</a> coerced to <code>@id</code> or <code>@vocab</code> is to be interpreted as an
  <a>IRI</a>. The difference between <code>@id</code> and <code>@vocab</code> is how values are expanded
  to <a>absolute IRIs</a>. <code>@vocab</code> first tries to expand the value
  by interpreting it as <a>term</a>. If no matching <a>term</a> is found in the
  <a>active context</a>, it tries to expand it as <a>compact IRI</a> or <a>absolute IRI</a>
  if there's a colon in the value; otherwise, it will expand the value using the
  <a data-lt="active context">active context's</a> <a>vocabulary mapping</a>, if present.
  Values coerced to <code>@id</code> in contrast are expanded as
  <a>compact IRI</a> or <a>absolute IRI</a> if a colon is present; otherwise, they are interpreted
  as <a>relative IRI</a>.</p>

<p class="note">The ability to coerce a value using a <a>term definition</a> is distinct
  from setting one or more types on a <a>node object</a>, as the former does not result in
  new data being added to the graph, while the later manages node types
  through adding additional relationships to the graph.</p>

<p><a>Terms</a> or <a>compact IRIs</a> used as the value of a
  <code>@type</code> key may be defined within the same context. This means that one may specify a
  <a>term</a> like <code>xsd</code> and then use <code>xsd:integer</code> within the same
  context definition.</p>

<p>The example below demonstrates how a JSON-LD author can coerce values to
<a>typed values</a> and <a>IRIs</a>.</p>

<p>The unexpected result is that "barney" expands to both <code>http://example1.com/barney</code>
  and <code>http://example2.com/barney</code>, depending where it is encountered.
  String values interpreted as <a>IRIs</a> because of the associated <a>term definitions</a>
  are typically considered to be document-relative.
  In some cases, it makes sense to interpret these relative to the vocabulary,
  prescribed using <code>"@type": "@vocab"</code> in the <a>term definition</a>, though this can
  lead to unexpected consequences such as these.</p>

<p>In the previous example, "barney" appears twice, once as the value of <code>@id</code>,
  which is always interpreted as a document-relative IRI, and once as the value of
  "fred", which is defined to be vocabulary-relative, thus the different expanded values.</p>

<p>For more on this see <a class="sectionRef" href="#default-vocabulary"></a>.</p>

<p>A variation on the previous example using <code>"@type": "@id"</code> instead
  of <code>@vocab</code> illustrates the behavior of interpreting "barney" relative to the document:</p>

<p>In this case the <code>@id</code> definition in the term definition is optional.
  If it does exist, the <a>compact IRI</a> or <a>IRI</a> representing
  the term will always be expanded to <a>IRI</a> defined by the <code>@id</code>
  key&mdash;regardless of whether a prefix is defined or not.</p>

<p>Type coercion is always performed using the unexpanded value of the key. In the
  example above, that means that type coercion is done looking for <code>foaf:age</code>
  in the <a>active context</a> and not for the corresponding, expanded
  <a>IRI</a> <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age</code>.</p>

<p class="note">Keys in the context are treated as <a>terms</a> for the purpose of
  expansion and value coercion. At times, this may result in multiple representations for the same expanded IRI.
  For example, one could specify that <code>dog</code> and <code>cat</code> both expanded to <code>http://example.com/vocab#animal</code>.
  Doing this could be useful for establishing different type coercion or language specification rules.</p>

  <p>To clear the <a>default language</a> for a subtree, <code>@language</code> can
    be set to <code>null</code> in an intervening context, such as a <a>scoped context</a> as follows:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Clearing default language">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      ####...####
      ****"@version": 1.1,****
      "@vocab": "http://example.com/",
      "@language": "ja",
      "details": {
        ****"@context": {
          "@language": null
        }****
      }
    },
    "name": "花澄",
    "details": {"occupation": "Ninja"}
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Second, it is possible to associate a language with a specific <a>term</a>
    using an <a>expanded term definition</a>:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Expanded term definition with language">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      ####...####
      "ex": "http://example.com/vocab/",
      "@language": "ja",
      "name": { "@id": "ex:name", ****"@language": null**** },
      "occupation": { "@id": "ex:occupation" },
      "occupation_en": { "@id": "ex:occupation", ****"@language": "en"**** },
      "occupation_cs": { "@id": "ex:occupation", ****"@language": "cs"**** }
    },
    ****"name": "Yagyū Muneyoshi",
    "occupation": "忍者",
    "occupation_en": "Ninja",
    "occupation_cs": "Nindža"****####,
    ...####
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>The example above would associate <em lang="ja">忍者</em> with the specified default
    language tag <code>ja</code>, <em lang="en">Ninja</em> with the language tag
    <code>en</code>, and <em lang="cs">Nindža</em> with the language tag <code>cs</code>.
    The value of <code>name</code>, <em lang="">Yagyū Muneyoshi</em> wouldn't be
    associated with any language tag since <code>@language</code> was reset to
    <a>null</a> in the <a>expanded term definition</a>.</p>

  <p class="note">Language associations are only applied to plain
    <a>strings</a>. <a>Typed values</a>
    or values that are subject to <a href="#type-coercion">type coercion</a>
    are not language tagged.</p>

  <p>Just as in the example above, systems often need to express the value of a
    property in multiple languages. Typically, such systems also try to ensure that
    developers have a programmatically easy way to navigate the data structures for
    the language-specific data. In this case, <a>language maps</a>
    may be utilized.</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Language map expressing a property in three languages">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      ####...####
      "occupation": { "@id": "ex:occupation", ****"@container": "@language"**** }
    },
    "name": "Yagyū Muneyoshi",
    "occupation": ****{
      "ja": "忍者",
      "en": "Ninja",
      "cs": "Nindža"
    }****
    ####...####
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>The example above expresses exactly the same information as the previous
    example but consolidates all values in a single property. To access the
    value in a specific language in a programming language supporting dot-notation
    accessors for object properties, a developer may use the
    <code>property.language</code> pattern
    (when languages are limited to the primary language sub-tag,
    and do not depend on other sub-tags, such as `"en-us"`).
    For example, to access the occupation
    in English, a developer would use the following code snippet:
    <code>obj.occupation.en</code>.</p>

  <p>Third, it is possible to override the <a>default language</a> by using a
    <a>value object</a>:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Overriding default language using an expanded value">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      ####...####
      "@language": "ja"
    },
    "name": "花澄",
    "occupation": ****{
      "@value": "Scientist",
      "@language": "en"
    }****
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>This makes it possible to specify a plain string by omitting the
    <code>@language</code> tag or setting it to <code>null</code> when expressing
    it using a <a>value object</a>:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Removing language information using an expanded value">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      ####...####
      "@language": "ja"
    },
    "name": ****{
      "@value": "Frank"
    }****,
    "occupation": {
      "@value": "Ninja",
      "@language": "en"
    },
    "speciality": "手裏剣"
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>See <a href="#language-maps" class="sectionRef"></a> for a description
    of using <a>language maps</a> to set the language of mapped values.</p>

<p>A JSON-LD author can express multiple values in a compact way by using
  <a>arrays</a>. Since graphs do not describe ordering for links

<p>The implementation of <a>lists</a> in RDF depends on linking anonymous nodes
  together using the properties <code>rdf:first</code> and
  <code>rdf:rest</code>, with the end of the list defined as the resource
  <code>rdf:nil</code>, as the "statements" tab illustrates.
  This allows order to be represented within an unordered set of statements.
</p>

<p>Both JSON-LD and Turtle provide shortcuts for representing ordered lists.</p>

<p class="changed">In JSON-LD 1.1, lists of lists, where the value of
  a <a>list object</a>, may itself be a <a>list object</a>, are
  fully supported.</p>

<p class="changed">Note that the <code>"@container": "@list"</code> definition recursively
  describes array values of lists as being, themselves, lists. For example, in [[[RFC7946]]] (see [[RFC7946]]),
  <em>coordinates</em> are an ordered list of <em>positions</em>, which are
  represented as an array of two or more numbers:</p>

<pre class="example changed nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
     data-content-type="application/json"
     title="Coordinates expressed in GeoJSON">
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "bbox": [-10.0, -10.0, 10.0, 10.0],
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [
        [
            [-10.0, -10.0],
            [10.0, -10.0],
            [10.0, 10.0],
            [-10.0, -10.0]
        ]
    ]
  }
  ####//...####
}
</pre>

<p class="changed">For these examples, it's important that values
  expressed within <em>bbox</em> and <em>coordinates</em> maintain their order,
  which requires the use of embedded list structures. In JSON-LD 1.1, we can
  express this using recursive lists, by simply adding the appropriate context
  definition:</p>

  <p>By defining <em>labels</em> using the <a>keyword</a> <code>@nest</code>,
    a <a>JSON-LD processor</a> will ignore the nesting created by using the
    <em>labels</em> property and process the contents as if it were declared
    directly within containing object. In this case, the <em>labels</em>
    property is semantically meaningless. Defining it as equivalent to
    <code>@nest</code> causes it to be ignored when expanding, making it

  <p>A <a>node object</a>, like the one used above, may be used in
    any value position in the body of a JSON-LD document.</p>

  <p>While it is considered a best practice to identify nodes in a graph,
    at times this is impractical. In the data model, nodes without an explicit
    identifier are called <a>blank nodes</a>, which can be represented in a
    serialization such as JSON-LD using a <a>blank node identifier</a>. In the
    previous example, the top-level node for Manu does not have an identifier,
    and does not need one to describe it within the data model. However, if we
    were to want to describe a <em>knows</em> relationship from Gregg to Manu,
    we would need to introduce a <a>blank node identifier</a>
    (here <code>_:b0</code>).</p>

  <p><a>Blank node identifiers</a> may be automatically introduced by algorithms such as <a>flattening</a>, but they are also useful for authors to describe such relationships directly.</p>

<section class="informative"><h2>Identifying Blank Nodes</h2>

  <p>At times, it becomes necessary to be able to express information without
    being able to uniquely identify the <a>node</a> with an <a>IRI</a>.
    This type of node is called a <a>blank node</a>. JSON-LD does not require
    all nodes to be identified using <code>@id</code>. However, some graph topologies
    may require identifiers to be serializable. Graphs containing loops, e.g., cannot
    be serialized using <a>embedding</a> alone, <code>@id</code> must be used to connect the nodes.
    In these situations, one can use <a>blank node identifiers</a>,
    which look like <a>IRIs</a> using an underscore (<code>_</code>)
    as scheme. This allows one to reference the node locally within the document, but
    makes it impossible to reference the node from an external document. The
    <a>blank node identifier</a> is scoped to the document in which it is used.</p>

  <p>The example above contains information about two secret agents that cannot be identified
    with an <a>IRI</a>. While expressing that <em>agent&nbsp;1</em> knows <em>agent&nbsp;2</em>
    is possible without using <a>blank node identifiers</a>,
    it is necessary to assign <em>agent&nbsp;1</em> an identifier so that it can be referenced
    from <em>agent&nbsp;2</em>.</p>
  <p>It is worth noting that blank node identifiers may be relabeled during processing.
    If a developer finds that they refer to the <a>blank node</a> more than once,
    they should consider naming the node using a dereferenceable <a>IRI</a> so that
    it can also be referenced from other documents.</p>

<section class="informative"><h2>Indexed Values</h2>

<p>Sometimes multiple property values need to be accessed
  in a more direct fashion than iterating though multiple array values. JSON-LD
  provides an indexing mechanism to allow the use of an intermediate <a>map</a>
  to associate specific indexes with associated values.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Data Indexing</dt><dd>As described in <a href="#data-indexing" class="sectionRef"></a>,
    data indexing allows an arbitrary key to reference a <a>node</a> or value.</dd>
  <dt>Language Indexing</dt><dd>As described in <a href="#language-indexing" class="sectionRef"></a>,
    language indexing allows a language to reference a <a>string</a> and be
    interpreted as the language associated with that string.</dd>
  <dt>Node Identifier Indexing</dt><dd>As described in <a href="#node-identifier-indexing" class="sectionRef"></a>,
    node identifier indexing allows an <a>IRI</a> to reference a <a>node</a>
    and be interpreted as the identifier of that <a>node</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Node Type Indexing</dt><dd>As described in <a href="#node-type-indexing" class="sectionRef"></a>,
    node type indexing allows an <a>IRI</a> to reference a <a>node</a>

<p>See <a href="#named-graphs" class="sectionRef"></a> for other uses of indexing in JSON-LD.</p>

<section class="informative"><h2>Data Indexing</h2>

  <p>Databases are typically used to make access to
    data more efficient. Developers often extend this sort of functionality into
    their application data to deliver similar performance gains.
    This data may have no meaning from a Linked Data standpoint, but is
    still useful for an application.</p>

  <p>JSON-LD introduces the notion of <a>index maps</a>
    that can be used to structure data into a form that is
    more efficient to access. The data indexing feature allows an author to
    structure data using a simple key-value map where the keys do not map
    to <a>IRIs</a>. This enables direct access to data
    instead of having to scan an array in search of a specific item.
    In JSON-LD such data can be specified by associating the
    <code>@index</code> <a>keyword</a> with a
    <code>@container</code> declaration in the context:</p>

  <p>In the example above, the <strong>athletes</strong> <a>term</a> has
    been marked as an <a>index map</a>.
    The <strong>catcher</strong> and <strong>pitcher</strong> keys will be ignored  semantically,

    If used in JavaScript, this can allow a developer to access a particular athlete using the
    following code snippet: <code>obj.athletes.pitcher</code>.</p>

  <p>The interpretation of the data is expressed in the statements table.
    <strong>Note how the index keys do not appear in the statements</strong>,

  <p class="warning">As data indexes are not preserved when round-tripping to RDF;
    this feature should be used judiciously.
    Often, other indexing mechanisms, which are preserved, are more appropriate.</p>

  <p class="changed">The value of <code>@container</code> can also

  <p>In the example above, the <strong>label</strong> <a>term</a> has
    been marked as a <a>language map</a>. The <strong>en</strong> and
    <strong>de</strong> keys are implicitly associated with their respective
    values by the <a>JSON-LD Processor</a>.  This allows a developer to
    access the German version of the <strong>label</strong> using the
    following code snippet: <code>obj.label.de</code>,
    which, again, is only appropriate when languages are limited to the
    primary language sub-tag and do not depend on other sub-tags, such as `"de-at"`.</p>

  <p>The value of <code>@container</code> can also
    be an array containing both <code>@language</code> and <code>@set</code>.
    When <em>compacting</em>, this ensures that a <a>JSON-LD Processor</a> will use
    the <a>array</a> form for all values of language tags.</p>

<section class="informative changed"><h2>Node Type Indexing</h2>

  <p>In addition to <a data-lt="id map">id</a> and <a>index maps</a>, JSON-LD introduces the notion of <a>type maps</a>
    for structuring data. The type indexing feature allows an author to
    structure data using a simple key-value map where the keys map
    to <a>IRIs</a>. This enables data to be structured based on the <code>@type</code>
    of specific <a>node objects</a>.
    In JSON-LD such data can be specified by associating the
    <code>@type</code> <a>keyword</a> with a
    <code>@container</code> declaration in the context:</p>

  <p>As with <a>id maps</a>, when used with <code>@type</code>, a container may also
    include <code>@set</code> to ensure that key values are always contained in an array.</p>

  <p>Sometimes it is also useful to list node objects as part of another node object.
    For instance, to represent a set of resources which are used by some other
    resource. <a>Included blocks</a> may be also be used to collect such secondary <a>node objects</a>
    which can be referenced from a primary <a>node object</a>.
    For an example, consider a node object containing a list of different items,
    some of which share some common elements:</p>

  <p>However, in contrast to `@graph`, `@included` does not interact with other <a>properties</a>
    contained within the same <a>map</a>, a feature discussed further in <a href="#named-graphs" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>
</section>

<section class="informative"><h2>Reverse Properties</h2>

  <p>JSON-LD serializes directed <a>graphs</a>. That means that
    every <a>property</a> points from a <a>node</a> to another <a>node</a>
    or <a data-lt="JSON-LD value">value</a>. However, in some cases, it is desirable
    to serialize in the reverse direction. Consider for example the case where a person
    and its children should be described in a document. If the used vocabulary does not
    provide a <em>children</em> <a>property</a> but just a <em>parent</em>
    <a>property</a>, every <a>node</a> representing a child would have to
    be expressed with a <a>property</a> pointing to the parent as in the following
    example.</p>

<section class="informative"><h2>Named Graphs</h2>

  <p>At times, it is necessary to make statements about a <a>graph</a>
    itself, rather than just a single <a>node</a>. This can be done by
    grouping a set of <a>nodes</a> using the <code>@graph</code>
    <a>keyword</a>. A developer may also name data expressed using the
    <code>@graph</code> <a>keyword</a> by pairing it with an
    <code>@id</code> <a>keyword</a> as shown in the following example:</p>

  <p>The example above expresses a <a>named graph</a> that is identified
    by the <a>IRI</a> <code>http://example.org/foaf-graph</code>. That
    graph is composed of the statements about Manu and Gregg. Metadata about
    the graph itself is expressed via the <code>generatedAt</code> property,
    which specifies when the graph was generated.</p>

  <p>When a JSON-LD document's top-level structure is an
    <a>map</a> that contains no other
    keys than <code>@graph</code> and
    optionally <code>@context</code> (properties that are not mapped to an
    <a>IRI</a> or a <a>keyword</a> are ignored),
    <code>@graph</code> is considered to express the otherwise implicit
    <a>default graph</a>. This mechanism can be useful when a number
    of <a>nodes</a> exist at the document's top level that
    share the same <a>context</a>, which is, e.g., the case when a
    document is <a href="#flattened-document-form">flattened</a>. The
    <code>@graph</code> keyword collects such nodes in an <a>array</a>
    and allows the use of a shared context.</p>

    <h3>Graph Containers</h3>
    <p>In some cases, it is useful to logically partition data into separate
      graphs, without making this explicit within the JSON expression. For
      example, a JSON document may contain data against which other metadata is
      asserted and it is useful to separate this data in the data model using
      the notion of <a>named graphs</a>, without the syntactic overhead
      associated with the <code>@graph</code> keyword.</p>

    <p>An <a>expanded term definition</a> can use <code>@graph</code> as the
      value of <code>@container</code>. This indicates that values of this
      <a>term</a> should be considered to be <a>named graphs</a>, where the
      <a>graph name</a> is an automatically assigned <a>blank node identifier</a>
      creating an <a>implicitly named graph</a>. When expanded, these become
      <a>simple graph objects</a>.</p>

   <p>A different example uses an anonymously <a>named graph</a> as follows:</p>

    <p>The example above expresses an anonymously <a>named graph</a>
      making a statement. The <a>default graph</a> includes a statement
      saying that the <a>subject</a> wrote that statement.
      This is an example of separating statements into a <a>named graph</a>, and then
      making assertions about the statements contained within that <a>named graph</a>.</p>

    <p class="note">Strictly speaking, the value of such a <a>term</a>
      is not a <a>named graph</a>, rather it is the <a>graph name</a>
      associated with the <a>named graph</a>, which exists separately within
      the <a>dataset</a>.</p>

<section class="informative changed"><h3>Named Graph Data Indexing</h3>

  <p>In addition to indexing <a>node objects</a> by index, <a>graph objects</a> may
    also be indexed by an index. By using the <code>@graph</code>
    container type, introduced in <a href="#graph-containers" class="sectionRef"></a>
    in addition to <code>@index</code>, an object value of such a property is
    treated as a key-value map where the keys do not map to <a>IRIs</a>, but
    are taken from an <code>@index</code> property associated with <a>named graphs</a>
    which are their values. When expanded, these must be <a>simple graph objects</a></p>

  <p>The following example describes a <a>default graph</a> referencing multiple named
    graphs using an <a>index map</a>.</p>

  <p>As with <a>index maps</a>, when used with <code>@graph</code>, a container may also
    include <code>@set</code> to ensure that key values are always contained in an array.</p>

  <p class="changed">The special index <code>@none</code> is used for indexing
    graphs which do not have an <code>@index</code> key, which is useful to maintain
    a normalized representation. <span class="note">Note, however, that
      compacting a document where multiple unidentified named graphs are
      compacted using the <code>@none</code> index will result in the content

  <p>As with <a>id maps</a>, when used with <code>@graph</code>, a container may also

  <p>As with <a>id maps</a>, the special index <code>@none</code> is used for indexing
    <a>named graphs</a> which do not have an <code>@id</code>, which is useful to maintain
    a normalized representation. The <code>@none</code> index may also be
    a term which expands to <code>@none</code>.
    <span class="note">Note, however, that if multiple graphs are represented without
      an <code>@id</code>, they will be merged on expansion. To prevent this,

<section class="informative"><h3>Loading Documents</h3>
  <p>The JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD11-API]]
    defines the interface to a <a>JSON-LD Processor</a> and includes
    a number of methods used for manipulating different forms
    of JSON-LD (see <a href="#forms-of-json-ld" class="sectionRef"></a>).
    This includes a general mechanism for loading remote documents,
    including referenced JSON-LD documents and remote contexts,
    and potentially extracting embedded JSON-LD from other formats such as [[HTML]].
    This is more fully described in
    <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#remote-document-and-context-retrieval">Remote Document and Context Retrieval</a>
    in [[JSON-LD11-API]].</p>

  <p>A <dfn data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#dom-jsonldoptions-documentloader">documentLoader</dfn>
    can be useful in a number of contexts where loading remote documents can be problematic:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remote context documents should be cached to prevent overloading the
      location of the remote context for each request.
      Normally, an HTTP caching infrastructure might be expected to handle this,
      but in some contexts this might not be feasible.
      A <a>documentLoader</a> implementation might provide separate logic for performing
      such caching.</li>
    <li>Non-standard URL schemes may not be widely implemented,
      or may have behavior specific to a given application domain.
      A <a>documentLoader</a> can be defined to implement document retrieval semantics.</li>
    <li>Certain well-known contexts may be statically cached within a <a>documentLoader</a> implementation.
      This might be particularly useful in embedded applications,
      where it is not feasible, or even possible, to access remote documents.</li>
    <li>For security purposes, the act of remotely retrieving a document may provide a signal of application behavior.
      The judicious use of a <a>documentLoader</a> can isolate the application and reduce its online fingerprint.</li>
  </ul>

<section class="informative"><h2>Forms of JSON-LD</h2>
<p>As with many data formats, there is no single correct way to describe data in JSON-LD.
  However, as JSON-LD is used for describing graphs, certain transformations can be used
  to change the shape of the data, without changing its meaning as Linked Data.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Expanded Document Form</dt>
<dd><a>Expansion</a> is the process of taking a JSON-LD document and applying a
    <a>context</a> so that the <code>@context</code> is no longer necessary.
    This process is described further in <a href="#expanded-document-form" class="sectionRef"></a>.</dd>
<dt>Compacted Document Form</dt>
<dd><a>Compaction</a> is the process
  of applying a provided <a>context</a> to an existing JSON-LD document. This process
  is described further in <a href="#compacted-document-form" class="sectionRef"></a>.</dd>
<dt>Flattened Document Form</dt>
<dd><a>Flattening</a> is the process of extracting
  embedded nodes to the top level of the JSON tree, and replacing the embedded
  node with a reference, creating blank node identifiers as necessary. This
  process is described further in <a href="#flattened-document-form" class="sectionRef"></a>.</dd>
<dt>Framed Document Form</dt>
<dd><a>Framing</a> is used to shape
  the data in a JSON-LD document, using an example <a>frame</a> document
  which is used to both match the <a>flattened</a> data and show an example
  of how the resulting data should be shaped. This

<section class="informative"><h3>Expanded Document Form</h3>

  <p>The JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD11-API]]

    <a>context</a> such that all IRIs, types, and values
    are expanded so that the <code>@context</code> is no longer necessary.</p>

  <p>For example, assume the following JSON-LD input document:</p>

<section class="informative"><h3>Compacted Document Form</h3>

  <p>The JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD11-API]] defines
    a method for <em>compacting</em> a JSON-LD document. <dfn data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#dfn-compact">Compaction</dfn> is the process
    of applying a developer-supplied <a>context</a> to shorten <a>IRIs</a>
    to <a>terms</a> or <a>compact IRIs</a>
    and JSON-LD values expressed in expanded form to simple values such as
    <a>strings</a> or <a>numbers</a>.
    Often this makes it simpler to work with document as the data is expressed in
    application-specific terms. Compacted documents are also typically easier to read
    for humans.</p>

  <p>For example, assume the following JSON-LD input document:</p>

  <pre id="sample-expanded-json-ld-document"
       class="example input" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Sample expanded JSON-LD document">
  <!--
  [

        {
         "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Additionally, assume the following developer-supplied JSON-LD context:</p>

  <pre id="sample-context"
       class="example context" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Sample context"
       data-context-for="Sample expanded JSON-LD document">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
      "homepage": {
        "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
        "@type": "@id"

  <p>Running the JSON-LD <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#compaction-algorithm">Compaction algorithm</a> given the <a>context</a> supplied above

    that is tailored to the use of the JSON-LD document directly as JSON.
    This includes representing values as <a>strings</a>, rather than <a>value objects</a>, where possible,
    shortening the use of <a>list objects</a> into simple <a>arrays</a>, reversing the relationship
    between <a>nodes</a>, and using data maps to index into multiple values instead of
    representing them as an array of values.</p>

  <section class="informative"><h3>Shortening IRIs</h3>
    <p>In an expanded JSON-LD document, <a>IRIs</a> are always represented as absolute <a>IRIs</a>.
      In many cases, it is preferable to use a shorter version, either a <a>relative IRI</a>,
      <a>compact IRI</a>, or <a>term</a>. Compaction uses a combination of elements
      in a context to create a shorter form of these IRIs. See
      <a href="#default-vocabulary" class="sectionRef"></a>,
      <a href="#base-iri" class="sectionRef"></a>,
      and <a href="#compact-iris" class="sectionRef"></a> for more details.</p>
    <p>The <a>vocabulary mapping</a> can be used to shorten IRIs that may be <em>vocabulary relative</em>
      by removing the IRI prefix that matches the <a>vocabulary mapping</a>.
      This is done whenever an IRI is determined to be vocabulary relative,
      i.e., used as a <a>property</a>, or a value of <code>@type</code>,
      or as the value of a <a>term</a> described as <code>"@type": "@vocab"</code>.</p>

  <section class="informative"><h3>Representing Values as Strings</h3>
    <p>To be unambiguous, the <a>expanded document form</a> always represents <a>nodes</a>
      and values using <a>node objects</a> and <a>value objects</a>.
      Moreover, property values are always contained within an array, even when there is only
      one value. Sometimes this is useful to maintain a uniformity of access,
      but most JSON data use the simplest possible representation, meaning that
      <a>properties</a> have single values, which are represented as <a>strings</a>
      or as structured values such as <a>node objects</a>.
      By default, <a>compaction</a> will represent values which are simple strings as <a>strings</a>,
      but sometimes a value is an <a>IRI</a>, a date, or some other <a>typed value</a> for which
      a simple string representation would loose information.
      By specifying this within a <a>term definition</a>,
      the semantics of a string value can be inferred from the definition
      of the <a>term</a> used as a <a>property</a>.

<section class="informative"><h3>Flattened Document Form</h3>

  <p>The JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD11-API]] defines
    a method for <em>flattening</em> a JSON-LD document.
    <dfn data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#dfn-flattened" data-lt="flattened">Flattening</dfn> collects all
    properties of a <a>node</a> in a single <a>map</a> and labels
    all <a>blank nodes</a> with
    <a>blank node identifiers</a>.
    This ensures a shape of the data and consequently may drastically simplify the code
    required to process JSON-LD in certain applications.</p>

  <p>For example, assume the following JSON-LD input document:</p>

  <pre id="sample-expanded-json-ld-document-to-be-flattened"
       class="example input" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Sample JSON-LD document to be flattened">

<section class="informative"><h3>Framed Document Form</h3>

    a method for <em>framing</em> a JSON-LD document. <dfn
    data-cite="JSON-LD11-FRAMING#dfn-framing">Framing</dfn> is used to shape
    the data in a JSON-LD document, using an example <a>frame</a> document
    which is used to both match the <a>flattened</a> data and show an example
    of how the resulting data should be shaped.</p>

  <p>For example, assume the following JSON-LD frame:</p>

  <pre id="sample-library-frame"

      "contains": {
        "@type": "Chapter"
      }
    }
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>This <a>frame</a> document describes an embedding structure that would place
    objects with type <em>Library</em> at the top, with objects of

    places objects of type <em>Chapter</em> within the referencing <em>Book</em> object
    as embedded values of the <em>Book</em> object.</p>

<section class="normative"><h2>Modifying Behavior with Link Relationships</h2>
  <p>Certain aspects of JSON-LD processing can be modified using
    <dfn data-cite="RFC8288#section-3" data-no-xref>HTTP Link Headers</dfn> [[RFC8288]].
    These can be used when retrieving resources that are not, themselves, JSON-LD,
    but can be interpreted as JSON-LD by using information in a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_relation" data-no-xref>Link Relation</a>.</p>

  <p>When processing normal JSON documents, a link relation can be specified using
    the <a>HTTP Link Header</a>
    returned when fetching a remote document, as described in <a href="#interpreting-json-as-json-ld" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>

  <p class="changed">In other cases, a resource may be returned using a representation that cannot easily be interpreted
    as JSON-LD. Normally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation">HTTP content negotiation</a>
    would be used to allow a client to specify a preference for JSON-LD over another representation,
    but in certain situations, it is not possible or practical for a server to respond appropriately to such requests.
    For this, an <a>HTTP Link Header</a> can be used to provide an alternate location for a document
    to be used in place of the originally requested resource,
    as described in <a href="#alternate-document-location" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>

<section class="normative"><h3>Interpreting JSON as JSON-LD</h3>

  <p>Ordinary JSON documents can be interpreted as JSON-LD
    by providing an explicit JSON-LD <a>context</a> document. One way
    to provide this is by using referencing a JSON-LD
    <a>context</a> document in an <a>HTTP Link Header</a>.
    Doing so allows JSON to be unambiguously machine-readable without requiring developers to drastically
    change their documents and provides an upgrade path for existing infrastructure
    without breaking existing clients that rely on the <code>application/json</code>
    media type or a media type with a <code>+json</code> suffix as defined in
    [[RFC6839]].</p>

  <p>In order to use an external context with an ordinary JSON document,
    when retrieving an ordinary JSON document via HTTP, processors MUST
    attempt to retrieve any <a>JSON-LD document</a> referenced by a
    <a data-cite="RFC8288#section-3">Link Header</a> with:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"</code>, and</li>
    <li><code>type="application/ld+json"</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The referenced document MUST have a top-level <a>JSON object</a>.
    The <code>@context</code> <a>entry</a> within that object is added to the top-level
    <a>JSON object</a> of the referencing document. If an <a>array</a>
    is at the top-level of the referencing document and its items are
    <a>JSON objects</a>, the <code>@context</code>
    subtree is added to all <a>array</a> items. All extra information located outside
    of the <code>@context</code> subtree in the referenced document MUST be
    discarded. Effectively this means that the <a>active context</a> is
    initialized with the referenced external <a>context</a>. A response MUST NOT
    contain more than one <a>HTTP Link Header</a> using the
    <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context</code> link relation.</p>

  <p>Other mechanisms for providing a JSON-LD Context MAY be described for other
    URI schemes.</p>

  <p>The JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD11-API]]
    provides for an <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#dom-jsonldoptions-expandcontext">expandContext</a> option for specifying
    a <a>context</a> to use when expanding JSON documents programmatically.</p>

  <p>The following example demonstrates the use of an external context with an
    ordinary JSON document over HTTP:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       data-content-type="http"
       data-ignore
       title="Referencing a JSON-LD context from a JSON document via an HTTP Link Header">
  <!--
  GET /ordinary-json-document.json HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com
  Accept: application/ld+json,application/json,*/*;q=0.1

  ====================================

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  ####...####

    "homepage": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/",
    "image": "http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/markuslanthaler"
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Please note that <a>JSON-LD documents</a>
    served with the <code>application/ld+json</code>
    media type MUST have all context information, including references to external
    contexts, within the body of the document. Contexts linked via a
    <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context</code> <a data-cite="RFC8288#section-3">HTTP Link Header</a> MUST be
    ignored for such documents.</p>
</section>

<section class="normative changed"><h3>Alternate Document Location</h3>

  <p>Documents which can't be directly interpreted as JSON-LD can provide an alternate location containing JSON-LD.
    One way to provide this is by referencing a JSON-LD document in an <a>HTTP Link Header</a>.
    This might be useful, for example, when the URL associated with a namespace naturally
    contains an HTML document, but the JSON-LD context associated with that URL is located elsewhere.</p>

  <p>To specify an alternate location, a non-JSON resource
    (i.e., one using a media type other than `application/json` or a derivative)
    can return the alternate location using a <a data-cite="RFC8288#section-3">Link Header</a> with:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>rel="alternate"</code>, and</li>
    <li><code>type="application/ld+json"</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A response MUST NOT contain more than one <a>HTTP Link Header</a> using the
    <code>alternate</code> link relation with <code>type="application/ld+json"</code> .</p>

  <p>Other mechanisms for providing an alternate location MAY be described for other
    URI schemes.</p>

  <p>The following example demonstrates the use of an alternate location with an
    ordinary HTTP document over HTTP:</p>

  <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
       data-content-type="http"
       data-ignore
       title="Specifying an alternate location via an HTTP Link Header">
  <!--
  GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com
  Accept: application/ld+json,application/json,*/*;q=0.1

  ====================================

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  ####...####
  Content-Type: ****text/html****
  ****Link: <alternate.jsonld>; rel="alternate"; type="application/ld+json"****

    </head>
    <body>
      <p>This is the primary entrypoint for a vocabulary</p>
    </body>
  </html>
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>A processor seeing a non-JSON result will note the presence of the link header
    and load that document instead.</p>

  <h1>Data Model</h1>

  <p>JSON-LD is a serialization format for Linked Data based on JSON.
    It is therefore important to distinguish between the syntax, which is
    defined by JSON in [[RFC8259]], and the <dfn>data model</dfn> which is
    an extension of the <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#data-model">RDF data model</a> [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]].
    The precise details of how JSON-LD relates to the RDF data model are given in
    <a class="sectionRef" href="#relationship-to-rdf"></a>.</p>

  <p>To ease understanding for developers unfamiliar with the RDF model, the
    following summary is provided:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <a>JSON-LD document</a> serializes a
      <a>RDF Dataset</a>
      [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]], which is a collection of <a>graphs</a>
      that comprises exactly one <a>default graph</a>
      and zero or more <a>named graphs</a>.
    </li>
    <li>The <a>default graph</a> does not have a name and MAY be empty.</li>
    <li>Each <a>named graph</a> is a pair consisting of an <a>IRI</a> or
      <a>blank node identifier</a> (the
      <a>graph name</a>)
      and a <a>graph</a>. Whenever practical, the <a>graph name</a> SHOULD be an <a>IRI</a>.</li>
    <li>A <a>graph</a>
      is a labeled directed graph, i.e., a set of <a>nodes</a>
      connected by directed-arcs.</li>
    <li>Every directed-arc is labeled with
      an <a>IRI</a> or a <a>blank node identifier</a>. Within the JSON-LD syntax
      these arc labels are called <a>properties</a>.
      Whenever practical, a directed-arc SHOULD be labeled with an <a>IRI</a>.
      <div class="note">The use of <a>blank node identifiers</a> to label properties is obsolete,
        and may be removed in a future version of JSON-LD.
        Consider using a document relative IRI, instead, such as `#`.</div>
    </li>
    <li>Every <a>node</a>
      is an <a>IRI</a>, a <a>blank node</a>, or a <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-literal">literal</a>,
      although syntactically <a>lists</a> and native JSON values may be represented directly.</li>
    <li>A <a>node</a> having an outgoing edge MUST be an <a>IRI</a> or a
      <a>blank node</a>.</li>
    <li>A <a>graph</a> MUST NOT contain unconnected <a>nodes</a>,
      i.e., nodes which are not connected by an <a>property</a> to any other <a>node</a>.

      <div class="note">
        This effectively just prohibits unnested, empty <a>node objects</a>
        and unnested <a>node objects</a> that contain only an <code>@id</code>.
        A document may have <a>nodes</a> which are unrelated, as long as one or more
        properties are defined, or the <a>node</a> is referenced from another <a>node object</a>.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>An <a>IRI</a> (Internationalized Resource Identifier) is a string that conforms to the syntax
      defined in [[RFC3987]]. <a>IRIs</a> used within a
      <a>graph</a> SHOULD return a Linked Data document describing
      the resource denoted by that <a>IRI</a> when being dereferenced.</li>
    <li>A <a>blank node</a> is a <a>node</a> which is neither an <a>IRI</a>,
      nor a <a>JSON-LD value</a>, nor a <a>list</a>. A blank node is identified

      is a string that can be used as an identifier for a <a>blank node</a> within
      the scope of a <a>JSON-LD document</a>. Blank node identifiers begin with
      <code>_:</code>.</li>
    <li>A <a>JSON-LD value</a> is a <a>typed value</a>, a <a>string</a> (which is interpreted
      as a <a>typed value</a> with type <code>xsd:string</code>), a <a>number</a>

      <a>typed values</a> with type <code>xsd:boolean</code>),
      or a <a>language-tagged string</a>.</li>
    <li>A <a>typed value</a> consists of a value, which is a string, and a type, which is an
      <a>IRI</a>.</li>
    <li>A <a>language-tagged string</a>

  <h1>JSON-LD Grammar</h1>

  <p>This section restates the syntactic conventions described in the
    previous sections more formally.</p>

  <p>A <a>JSON-LD document</a> MUST be valid <a data-cite="RFC8259#section-2">JSON text</a> as described
    in [[RFC8259]], <span class="changed">or some format that can be represented
      in the <a>JSON-LD internal representation</a> that is equivalent to
      valid <a data-cite="RFC8259#section-2">JSON text</a></span>.</p>

  <p>A <a>JSON-LD document</a> MUST be a single <a>node object</a>,
    a <a>map</a> consisting of only
    the <a>entries</a> <code>@context</code> and/or <code>@graph</code>,
    or an <a>array</a> of zero or more <a>node objects</a>.</p>

  <p>In contrast to JSON, in JSON-LD the keys in <a data-lt="JSON object">objects</a>
    MUST be unique.</p>

  <p>Whenever a <a>keyword</a> is discussed in this grammar,
    the statements also apply to an alias for that <a>keyword</a>.</p>

  <p class="note">JSON-LD allows <a>keywords</a> to be aliased
    (see <a class="sectionRef" href="#aliasing-keywords"></a> for details). For example, if the <a>active context</a>
    defines the <a>term</a> <code>id</code> as an alias for <code>@id</code>,
    that alias may be legitimately used as a substitution for <code>@id</code>.
    Note that <a>keyword</a> aliases are not expanded during context
    processing.</p>

  <section id="terms" class="normative">
    <h2>Terms</h2>

    <p>A <a>term</a> is a short-hand <a>string</a> that expands
      to an <a>IRI</a>, <a>blank node identifier</a>, or <a>keyword</a>.</p>

    <p>A <a>term</a> MUST NOT equal any of the JSON-LD <a>keywords</a>,
      <span class="changed">other than `@type`</span>.</p>

    <p class="changed">When used as the <a>prefix</a> in a <a>Compact IRI</a>, to avoid
      the potential ambiguity of a <a>prefix</a> being confused with an IRI
      scheme, <a>terms</a> MUST NOT come from the list of URI schemes as defined in
      [[IANA-URI-SCHEMES]]. Similarly, to avoid confusion between a
      <a>Compact IRI</a> and a <a>term</a>, terms SHOULD NOT include a colon (<code>:</code>)
      and SHOULD be restricted to the form of
      <code><a data-cite="RFC3987#section-2.2">isegment-nz-nc</a></code>
      as defined in [[RFC3987]].</p>

    <p>To avoid forward-compatibility issues, a <a>term</a> SHOULD NOT start
      with an <code>@</code> character as future versions of JSON-LD may introduce
      additional <a>keywords</a>. Furthermore, the term MUST NOT
      be an empty <a>string</a> (<code>""</code>) as not all programming languages
      are able to handle empty JSON keys.</p>

    <p>See <a class="sectionRef" href="#the-context"></a> and
      <a class="sectionRef" href="#iris"></a> for further discussion
      on mapping <a>terms</a> to <a>IRIs</a>.</p>

  <section class="normative">
    <h2>Node Objects</h2>

    <p>A <a>node object</a> represents zero or more properties of a
      <a>node</a> in the <a>graph</a> serialized by the
      <a>JSON-LD document</a>. A <a>map</a> is a
      <a>node object</a> if it exists outside of a JSON-LD
      <a>context</a> and:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>it is not the top-most <a>map</a> in the JSON-LD document consisting
        of no other <a>entries</a> than <code>@graph</code> and <code>@context</code>,</li>
      <li>it does not contain the <code>@value</code>, <code>@list</code>,
        or <code>@set</code> keywords, and</li>
      <li class="changed">it is not a <a>graph object</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <a>properties</a> of a <a>node</a> in
      a <a>graph</a> may be spread among different
      <a>node objects</a> within a document. When
      that happens, the keys of the different
      <a>node objects</a> need to be merged to create the
      properties of the resulting <a>node</a>.</p>

    <p>A <a>node object</a> MUST be a <a>map</a>. All keys
      which are not <a>IRIs</a>, <a>compact IRIs</a>, <a>terms</a> valid in the
      <a>active context</a>, or one of the following <a>keywords</a>
      <span class="changed">(or alias of such a keyword)</span>
      MUST be ignored when processed:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>@context</code>,</li>
      <li><code>@id</code>,</li>
      <li class="changed">`@included`,</li>
      <li><code>@graph</code>,</li>
      <li class="changed"><code>@nest</code>,</li>
      <li><code>@type</code>,</li>
      <li><code>@reverse</code>, or</li>
      <li><code>@index</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the <a>node object</a> contains the <code>@context</code>
      key, its value MUST be <a>null</a>, an <a>absolute IRI</a>,
      a <a>relative IRI</a>, a <a>context definition</a>, or
      an <a>array</a> composed of any of these.</p>

    <p>If the <a>node object</a> contains the <code>@id</code> key,
      its value MUST be an <a>absolute IRI</a>, a <a>relative IRI</a>,
      or a <a>compact IRI</a> (including
      <a>blank node identifiers</a>).
      See <a class="sectionRef" href="#node-identifiers"></a>,
      <a class="sectionRef" href="#compact-iris"></a>, and
      <a class="sectionRef" href="#identifying-blank-nodes"></a> for further discussion on
      <code>@id</code> values.</p>

    <p>If the <a>node object</a> contains the <code>@graph</code>
      key, its value MUST be
      a <a>node object</a> or
      an <a>array</a> of zero or more <a>node objects</a>.
      If the <a>node object</a> also contains an <code>@id</code> keyword,
      its value is used as the <a>graph name</a> of a <a>named graph</a>.
      See <a class="sectionRef" href="#named-graphs"></a> for further discussion on
      <code>@graph</code> values. As a special case, if a <a>map</a>
      contains no keys other than <code>@graph</code> and <code>@context</code>, and the
      <a>map</a> is the root of the JSON-LD document, the
      <a>map</a> is not treated as a <a>node object</a>; this
      is used as a way of defining <a>node objects</a>
      that may not form a connected graph. This allows a
      <a>context</a> to be defined which is shared by all of the constituent
      <a>node objects</a>.</p>

    <p>If the <a>node object</a> contains the <code>@type</code>
      key, its value MUST be either an <a>absolute IRI</a>, a
      <a>relative IRI</a>, a <a>compact IRI</a>
      (including <a>blank node identifiers</a>),
      a <a>term</a> defined in the <a>active context</a> expanding into an <a>absolute IRI</a>, or
      an <a>array</a> of any of these.
      See <a class="sectionRef" href="#specifying-the-type"></a> for further discussion on
      <code>@type</code> values.</p>

    <p>If the <a>node object</a> contains the <code>@reverse</code> key,
      its value MUST be a <a>map</a> containing <a>entries</a> representing reverse
      properties. Each value of such a reverse property MUST be an <a>absolute IRI</a>,
      a <a>relative IRI</a>, a <a>compact IRI</a>, a <a>blank node identifier</a>,
      a <a>node object</a> or an <a>array</a> containing a combination of these.</p>

    <p class="changed">If the <a>node object</a> contains the `@included` key,
      its value MUST be an <a>included block</a>.
      See <a class="sectionRef" href="#included-blocks"></a> for further discussion
      on <a>included blocks</a>.</p>

    <p>If the <a>node object</a> contains the <code>@index</code> key,
      its value MUST be a <a>string</a>. See
      <a class="sectionRef" href="#data-indexing"></a> for further discussion
      on <code>@index</code> values.</p>

    <p class="changed">If the <a>node object</a> contains the <code>@nest</code> key,
      its value MUST be a <a>map</a> or an <a>array</a> of <a>map</a>
      which MUST NOT include a <a>value object</a>. See
      <a class="sectionRef" href="#property-nesting"></a> for further discussion
      on <code>@nest</code> values.</p>

    <p>Keys in a <a>node object</a> that are not
      <a>keywords</a> MAY expand to an <a>absolute IRI</a>
      using the <a>active context</a>. The values associated with keys that expand
      to an <a>absolute IRI</a> MUST be one of the following:</p>

    <h2>Graph Objects</h2>

    <p>A <a>graph object</a> represents a <a>named graph</a>, which MAY include
      an explicit <a>graph name</a>.
      A <a>map</a> is a <a>graph object</a> if
      it exists outside of a JSON-LD <a>context</a>,
      it contains an <code>@graph</code> <a>entry</a> (or an alias of that <a>keyword</a>),
      it is not the top-most <a>map</a> in the JSON-LD document, and
      it consists of no <a>entries</a> other than <code>@graph</code>,
      <code>@index</code>, <code>@id</code>
      and <code>@context</code>, or an alias of one of these <a>keywords</a>.</p>

    <p>If the <a>graph object</a> contains the <code>@context</code>
      key, its value MUST be <a>null</a>, an <a>absolute IRI</a>,
      a <a>relative IRI</a>, a <a>context definition</a>, or
      an <a>array</a> composed of any of these.</p>

    <p>If the <a>graph object</a> contains the <code>@id</code> key,
      its value is used as the identifier (<a>graph name</a>) of a <a>named graph</a>, and
      MUST be an <a>absolute IRI</a>, a <a>relative IRI</a>,
      or a <a>compact IRI</a> (including

    <p>A <a>graph object</a> without an <code>@id</code> <a>entry</a> is also a
      <a>simple graph object</a> and represents a <a>named graph</a> without an
      explicit identifier, although in the data model it still has a
      <a>graph name</a>, which is an implicitly allocated
      <a>blank node identifier</a>.</p>

      keys at the same time.
      A <a>value object</a> MUST NOT contain any other keys that expand to an
      <a>absolute IRI</a> or <a>keyword</a>.</p>

    <p>The value associated with the <code>@value</code> key MUST be either a

      a <a>compact IRI</a>,
      an <a>absolute IRI</a>,
      a string which can be turned into an <a>absolute IRI</a> using the <a>vocabulary mapping</a>,

    <h2>Lists and Sets</h2>

    <p>A <a>list</a> represents an <em>ordered</em> set of values. A set
      represents an <em>unordered</em> set of values. Unless otherwise specified,

      <code>@set</code> keyword, when used in the body of a JSON-LD document,
      represents just syntactic sugar which is optimized away when processing the document.
      However, it is very helpful when used within the context of a document. Values
      of terms associated with an <code>@set</code> or <code>@list</code> container
      will always be represented in the form of an <a>array</a> when a document
      is processed&mdash;even if there is just a single value that would otherwise be optimized to
      a non-array form in <a>compacted document form</a>.
      This simplifies post-processing of the data as the data is always in a
      deterministic form.</p>

    <p>A <a>list object</a> MUST be a <a>map</a> that contains no
      keys that expand to an <a>absolute IRI</a> or <a>keyword</a> other
      than <code>@list</code> and <code>@index</code>.</p>

      Please note that the <code>@index</code> key will be ignored when being processed.</p>

  <h2>Relationship to RDF</h2>

  <p>JSON-LD is a
    <dfn data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-concrete-rdf-syntax">concrete RDF syntax</dfn>
    as described in [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]]. Hence, a JSON-LD document is both an
    RDF document <em>and</em> a JSON document and correspondingly represents an
    instance of an <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#data-model">RDF data model</a>. However, JSON-LD also extends the RDF data
    model to optionally allow JSON-LD to serialize
    <dfn data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-generalized-rdf-dataset" data-lt="generalized rdf dataset">generalized RDF Datasets</dfn>.
    The JSON-LD extensions to the RDF data model are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>In JSON-LD <a>properties</a> can be
      <a>IRIs</a> or <a>blank nodes</a>
      whereas in RDF properties (<a>predicates</a>) have to be <a>IRIs</a>. This
      means that JSON-LD serializes
      <a>generalized RDF Datasets</a>.</li>
    <li>In JSON-LD <a>lists</a> use native JSON syntax, either contained in a
      list object, or described as such within a context. Consequently, developers
      using the JSON representation can access list elements directly rather than
      using the vocabulary for collections described in [[RDF-SCHEMA]].</li>
    <li>RDF values are either typed <em>literals</em>
      (<a>typed values</a>) or
      <a>language-tagged strings</a> whereas
      JSON-LD also supports JSON's native data types, i.e., <a>number</a>,
      <a>strings</a>, and the boolean values <code>true</code>
      and <code>false</code>. The JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD11-API]]
      defines the <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#data-round-tripping">conversion rules</a>
      between JSON's native data types and RDF's counterparts to allow round-tripping.</li>
    <li class="changed">As an extension to the <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#data-model">RDF data model</a>,
      <em>typed literals</em>, where the datatype is `xsd:string`, or <a>language-tagged strings</a>
      MAY include a <a>base direction</a>.
      As there is currently no standardized mechanism for representing the <a>base direction</a>
      of <a>RDF literals</a>, the JSON-LD to RDF transformation loses the base direction.
      The <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#deserialize-json-ld-to-rdf-algorithm">Deserialize JSON-LD to RDF Algorithm</a>
      also provides a means of representing <a>base direction</a>
      using non-standardized mechanisms which will preserve round-tripping through RDF.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">The use of <a>blank node identifiers</a> to label properties is obsolete,
    and may be removed in a future version of JSON-LD, as is the support for <a>generalized RDF Datasets</a>.</p>

  <p>Summarized, these differences mean that JSON-LD is capable of serializing any RDF
    <a>graph</a> or <a>dataset</a> and most, but not all, JSON-LD documents can be directly
    interpreted as RDF as described in RDF 1.1 Concepts [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]].</p>

  <p>Authors are strongly encouraged to avoid labeling properties using <a>blank node identifiers</a>,
    instead, consider one of the following mechanisms:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a <a>relative IRI</a>, either relative to the document or the vocabulary
      (see <a href="#document-relative-vocabulary-mapping" class="sectionRef"></a> for a discussion on using the document base as part of the <a>vocabulary mapping</a>),</li>
    <li>a URN such as <code>urn:example:1</code>, see [[?URN]], or</li>
    <li>a "Skolem IRI" as per
      <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#section-skolemization">Replacing Blank Nodes with IRIs</a>
      of [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]].</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The normative algorithms for interpreting JSON-LD as RDF and serializing
    RDF as JSON-LD are specified in the JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API
    specification [[JSON-LD11-API]].</p>

  <p>Even though JSON-LD serializes
    <a>RDF Datasets</a>, it can
    also be used as a <dfn data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-source">graph source</dfn>.
    In that case, a consumer MUST only use the <a>default graph</a> and ignore all <a>named graphs</a>.
    This allows servers to expose data in languages such as Turtle and JSON-LD
    using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation">HTTP content negotiation</a>.</p>

  <p class="note">Publishers supporting both <a>dataset</a> and <a>graph</a> syntaxes have to ensure that
    the primary data is stored in the <a>default graph</a> to enable consumers that do not support
    <a>datasets</a> to process the information.</p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h3>Serializing/Deserializing RDF</h3>

    <p>The process of serializing RDF as JSON-LD and deserializing JSON-LD to RDF
      depends on executing the algorithms defined in
      <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#rdf-serialization-deserialization-algorithms">RDF Serialization-Deserialization Algorithms</a>
      in the JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD11-API]].
      It is beyond the scope of this document to detail these algorithms any further,
      but a summary of the necessary operations is provided to illustrate the process.</p>

    <p>The procedure to deserialize a JSON-LD document to RDF involves the
      following steps:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Expand the JSON-LD document, removing any context; this ensures
        that properties, types, and values are given their full representation
        as <a>IRIs</a> and expanded values. <a>Expansion</a>
        is discussed further in <a class="sectionRef" href="#expanded-document-form"></a>.</li>
      <li>Flatten the document, which turns the document into an array of
        <a>node objects</a>. Flattening is discussed
        further in <a class="sectionRef" href="#flattened-document-form"></a>.</li>
      <li>Turn each <a>node object</a> into a series of <a>triples</a>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For example, consider the following JSON-LD document in compact form:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Sample JSON-LD document">
    <!--
    {
      "@context": {
        "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
        "knows": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows"
      },
      "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
      "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
      "knows": [
        {
          "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
          "name": "Manu Sporny"
        }, {
          "name": "Dave Longley"
        }
      ]
    }
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>Running the JSON-LD <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#expansion-algorithm">Expansion</a> and <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-API#flattening-algorithm">Flattening</a> algorithms against the
      JSON-LD input document in the example above would result in the
      following output:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Flattened and expanded form for the previous example">
    <!--
    [
      {
        "@id": "_:b0",
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": "Dave Longley"
      }, {
        "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": "Manu Sporny"
      }, {
        "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": "Markus Lanthaler",
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows": [
          { "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu" },
          { "@id": "_:b0" }
        ]
      }
    ]
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>Deserializing this to RDF now is a straightforward process of turning
      each <a>node object</a> into one or more <a>triples</a>. This can be
      expressed in Turtle as follows:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         data-content-type="text/turtle"
         data-result-for="Flattened and expanded form for the previous example"
         data-to-rdf
         title="Turtle representation of expanded/flattened document">
    <!--
    @prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

    _:b0 foaf:name "Dave Longley" .

    <http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu> foaf:name "Manu Sporny" .

    <http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/> foaf:name "Markus Lanthaler" ;
        foaf:knows <http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu>, _:b0 .
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>The process of serializing RDF as JSON-LD can be thought of as the
      inverse of this last step, creating an expanded JSON-LD document closely
      matching the triples from RDF, using a single <a>node object</a>
      for all triples having a common subject, and a single <a>property</a>
      for those triples also having a common <a>predicate</a>. The result may
      then be framed by using the
      <a data-cite="JSON-LD11-FRAMING#framing-algorithm">Framing Algorithm</a>
      described in [[JSON-LD11-FRAMING]] to create the desired object embedding.</p>

  <p class="note">Future versions of this specification
    may incorporate subresource integrity [[?SRI]] as a means of ensuring that cached and retrieved

<section id="privacy">
  <h3>Privacy Considerations</h3>
  <p>The retrieval of external contexts can expose the operation of a JSON-LD processor,
    allow intermediate nodes to fingerprint the client application through introspection of retrieved resources
    (see [[?fingerprinting-guidance]]),
    and provide an opportunity for a man-in-the-middle attack.
    To protect against this, publishers should consider caching remote contexts for future use,
    or use the <a>documentLoader</a>
    to maintain a local version of such contexts.</p>
</section>

<section id="internationalization">
  <h3>Internationalization Considerations</h3>
  <p>As JSON-LD uses the RDF data model, it is restricted by design in its ability to
    properly record <a>JSON-LD Values</a> which are <a>strings</a> with left-to-right or right-to-left direction indicators.
    Both JSON-LD and RDF provide a mechanism for specifying the language associated with
    a string (<a>language-tagged string</a>), but do not provide a means of indicating
    the base direction of the string.</p>

  <p>Unicode provides a mechanism for signaling direction within a string
    (see [[[UAX9]]] [[UAX9]]),
    however, when a string has an overall base direction which cannot be determined by the
    beginning of the string, an external indicator is required,
    such as the [[HTML]] <a data-cite="HTML/dom.html#the-dir-attribute">dir attribute</a>,
    which currently has no counterpart for <a>RDF literals</a>.</p>

  <p>The issue of properly representing <a>base direction</a> in RDF is not something that
    this Working Group can handle, as it is a limitation or the core RDF data model.
    This Working Group expects that a future RDF Working Group will consider the matter
    and add the ability to specify the base direction of <a>language-tagged strings</a>.</p>

  <p>Until a more comprehensive solution can be addressed in a future version of this
    specification, publishers should consider this issue when representing strings
    where the base direction of the string cannot otherwise be correctly inferred
    based on the content of the string.
    See [[?string-meta]] for a discussion best practices for
    identifying language and base direction for strings used on the Web.</p>

      <h4>Conversion of native data types</h4>

      <p>In JSON-LD numbers and boolean values are native data types. While [[Turtle]]
        has a shorthand syntax to express such values, RDF's abstract syntax requires
        that numbers and boolean values are represented as typed literals. Thus,
        to allow full round-tripping, the JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD11-API]]
        defines conversion rules between JSON-LD's native data types and RDF's
        counterparts. <a>Numbers</a> without fractions are
        converted to <code>xsd:integer</code>-typed literals, numbers with fractions
        to <code>xsd:double</code>-typed literals and the two boolean values
        <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> to a <code>xsd:boolean</code>-typed
        literal. All typed literals are in canonical lexical form.</p>

          <p>A non-empty list of space-separated URIs identifying specific
            constraints or conventions that apply to a JSON-LD document according to [[RFC6906]].
            A profile does not change the semantics of the resource representation
            when processed without profile knowledge, so that clients both with
            and without knowledge of a profiled resource can safely use the same
            representation. The <code>profile</code> parameter MAY be used by
            clients to express their preferences in the content negotiation process.
            If the profile parameter is given, a server SHOULD return a document that
            honors the profiles in the list which it recognizes,
            and MUST ignore the profiles in the list which it does not recognize.
            It is RECOMMENDED that profile URIs are dereferenceable and provide
            useful documentation at that URI. For more information and background
            please refer to [[RFC6906]].</p>
          <p>This specification defines six values for the <code>profile</code> parameter.</p>

          <p class="note">Other specifications may publish additional profile parameter
            URIs with their own defined semantics.</p>
          <p>
            When used as a <a data-cite="RFC4288#section-4.3">media type parameter</a> [[RFC4288]]
            in an <a data-cite="rfc7231#section-5.3.2">HTTP Accept header</a> [[RFC7231]],
            the value of the <code>profile</code> parameter MUST be enclosed in quotes (<code>"</code>) if it contains
            special characters such as whitespace, which is required when multiple profile URIs are combined.</p>
          <p>When processing the "profile" media type parameter, it is important to
            note that its value contains one or more URIs and not IRIs. In some cases
            it might therefore be necessary to convert between IRIs and URIs as specified in
            <a data-cite="RFC3986#section-5.1">section 3 Relationship between IRIs and URIs</a>
            of [[RFC3987]].</p>

      <p>Since JSON-LD is intended to be a pure data exchange format for
        directed graphs, the serialization SHOULD NOT be passed through a
        code execution mechanism such as JavaScript's <code>eval()</code>
        function to be parsed. An (invalid) document may contain code that,
        when executed, could lead to unexpected side effects compromising
        the security of a system.</p>
      <p>When processing JSON-LD documents, links to remote contexts and frames are
        typically followed automatically, resulting in the transfer of files
        without the explicit request of the user for each one. If remote
        contexts are served by third parties, it may allow them to gather
        usage patterns or similar information leading to privacy concerns.
        Specific implementations, such as the API defined in the
        JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD11-API]],
        may provide fine-grained mechanisms to control this behavior.</p>
      <p>JSON-LD contexts that are loaded from the Web over non-secure connections,
        such as HTTP, run the risk of being altered by an attacker such that
        they may modify the JSON-LD <a>active context</a> in a way that
        could compromise security. It is advised that any application that
        depends on a remote context for mission critical purposes vet and
        cache the remote context before allowing the system to use it.</p>
      <p>Given that JSON-LD allows the substitution of long IRIs with short terms,
        JSON-LD documents may expand considerably when processed and, in the worst case,
        the resulting data might consume all of the recipient's resources. Applications
        should treat any data with due skepticism.</p>
      <p>As JSON-LD places no limits on the IRI schemes that may be used,
        and vocabulary-relative IRIs use string concatenation rather than
        IRI resolution, it is possible to construct IRIs that may be
        used maliciously, if dereferenced.</p>

  <h2>Changes since 1.0 Recommendation of 16 January 2014</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A context may contain a <code>@version</code> <a>entry</a> which is used to set the <a>processing mode</a>.</li>
    <li>An <a>expanded term definition</a> can now have an
      <code>@context</code> property, which defines a <a>context</a> used for values of
      a <a>property</a> identified with such a <a>term</a>.</li>
    <li><code>@container</code> values within an <a>expanded term definition</a> may now
      include <code>@id</code>, <code>@graph</code> and <code>@type</code>, corresponding to <a>id maps</a> and <a>type maps</a>.</li>
    <li>An <a>expanded term definition</a> can now have an
      <code>@nest</code> property, which identifies a term expanding to
      <code>@nest</code> which is used for containing properties using the same
      <code>@nest</code> mapping. When expanding, the values of a property
      expanding to <code>@nest</code> are treated as if they were contained
      within the enclosing <a>node object</a> directly.</li>
    <li>The JSON syntax has been abstracted into an <a>internal representation</a>
      to allow for other serializations that are functionally equivalent
      to JSON.</li>
    <li>Added <a href="#node-identifier-indexing" class="sectionRef"></a> and <a href="#node-type-indexing" class="sectionRef"></a>.</li>
    <li>Both <a>language maps</a> and <a>index maps</a> may legitimately have an <code>@none</code> key, but
      [[[JSON-LD]]] only allowed <a>string</a> keys. This has been updated
      to allow <code>@none</code> keys.</li>
    <li>The value for <code>@container</code> in an <a>expanded term definition</a>
      can also be an <a>array</a> containing any appropriate container
      keyword along with <code>@set</code> (other than <code>@list</code>).
      This allows a way to ensure that such property values will always
      be expressed in <a>array</a> form.</li>
    <li>In JSON-LD 1.1, terms will be chosen as <a>compact IRI</a> prefixes
      when compacting only if
      a <a>simple term definition</a> is used where the value ends with a URI <a data-cite="RFC3986#section-2.2">gen-delim</a> character,
      or if their <a>expanded term definition</a> contains
      a <code>@prefix</code> <a>entry</a> with the value <code>true</code>. The 1.0 algorithm has
      been updated to only consider terms that map to a value that ends with a URI
      <a data-cite="RFC3986#section-2.2">gen-delim</a> character.</li>
    <li>Values of properties where the associated <a>term definition</a>
      has <code>@container</code> set to <code>@graph</code> are interpreted as
      <a>implicitly named graphs</a>, where the associated graph name is
      assigned from a new <a>blank node identifier</a>. Other combinations
      include <code>["@container", "@id"]</code>, <code>["@container", "@index"]</code> each also
      may include <code>"@set"</code>, which create maps from the
      graph identifier or index value similar to <a>index maps</a>
      and <a>id maps</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additionally, see <a href="#changes-from-cg" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>

  <h2>Changes since JSON-LD Community Group Final Report</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a>Lists</a> may now have items which are themselves <a>lists</a>.</li>
    <li>Values of <code>@type</code>, or an alias of <code>@type</code>, may now have their <code>@container</code> set to <code>@set</code>
      to ensure that <code>@type</code> <a>entries</a> are always represented as an array. This
      also allows a term to be defined for <code>@type</code>, where the value MUST be a <a>map</a>
      with <code>@container</code> set to <code>@set</code>.</li>
    <li>The use of <a>blank node identifiers</a> to label properties is obsolete,
      and may be removed in a future version of JSON-LD, as is the support for <a>generalized RDF Datasets</a>.</li>
    <li>The <a>vocabulary mapping</a> can be a relative IRI, which is evaluated
      either against an existing default vocabulary, or against the document base.
      This allows vocabulary-relative IRIs, such as the
      keys of <a>node objects</a>, are expanded or compacted relative
      to the document base.
      (See <a href="#iana-security">Security Considerations</a> in <a href="#iana-considerations" class="sectionRef"></a>
        for a discussion on how string vocabulary-relative IRI resolution via concatenation.
      )</li>
    <li>Added support for <code>"@type": "@none"</code> in a <a>term definition</a> to prevent value compaction.
      Define the <code>rdf:JSON</code> datatype.</li>
    <li><a>Term definitions</a> with keys which are of the form of a <a>compact IRI</a> or <a>absolute IRI</a> MUST NOT
      expand to an <a>IRI</a> other than the expansion of the key itself.</li>
    <li>A <a>frame</a> may also be located within an HTML document, identified
      using type <code>application/ld+json;profile=http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#frame</code>.</li>
    <li>Term definitions can now be <a href="#protected-term-definitions">protected</a>,
      to limit the ability of other contexts to override them.</li>
    <li>A <a>context</a> defined in an <a>expanded term definition</a> may also be used for values
      of <code>@type</code>, which defines a <a>context</a> to use for <a>node objects</a> including the associated type.</li>
    <li>By default, all contexts are propagated when traversing <a>node objects</a>, other than
      <a>type-scoped contexts</a>. This can be controlled using the <code>@propagate</code>
      <a>entry</a> in a <a>local context</a>.</li>
    <li>A context may contain an <code>@import</code> <a>entry</a> used to reference a remote context
      within a context, allowing <code>JSON-LD 1.1</code> features to be added to contexts originally
      authored for <code>JSON-LD 1.0</code>.</li>
    <li>A <a>node object</a> may include an <a>included block</a>,
      which is used to contain a set of <a>node objects</a> which are treated
      exactly as if they were <a>node objects</a> defined in an <a>array</a> including the containing
      <a>node object</a>.
      This allows the use of the object form of a JSON-LD document when there is more
      than one <a>node object</a> being defined, and where those <a>node objects</a>
      are not embedded as values of the containing <a>node object</a>.</li>
    <li>The `alternate` link relation can be used to supply an alternate location for
      retrieving a JSON-LD document when the returned document is not JSON.</li>
    <li><a>Value objects</a>, and associated <a>context</a> and <a>term definitions</a> have been updated to 
      support `@direction` for setting the <a>base direction</a> of strings.</li>
