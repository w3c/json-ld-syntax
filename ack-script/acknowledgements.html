    <h3>In Memoriam</h3>
    <p>Gregg Kellogg was a central figure in the story of JSON-LD. He worked
    tirelessly on JSON-LD and many other specifications for more than a decade,
    right up until his death on September 6th, 2025. Gregg’s passion for solving
    hard problems with finesse was only exceeded by his willingness to collaborate
    with and encourage others in reaching that destination. The JSON-LD and
    broader Linked Data communities will be forever grateful for Gregg’s
    consistent, careful, and kindly delivered contributions during their most
    formative years.</p>
